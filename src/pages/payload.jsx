                    "Lung cancer is the overgrowth of cells in digestive organs. Identifying different types of lung cancer (squamous cell cancer, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) from lung histopathological images is outrageous works that shorten the chance of infected with lung cancer in the future. This research propounds an accurate diagnosis scheme using various neural network features and fusion of contourlet transform from lung histopathological image. This lesson has used several pre-train models (Alexnet, ResNet50, and VGG-16) in addition to divers scratch models while the pre-train Resnet50 model works better. The two reduction techniques (Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR)) have used to classify the type of lung cancer with the extraction of the most significant properties. In Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based lung cancer detection, the reduction approach PCA performs better. This proposed methodology is performed on ordinary datasets and establishes comparative better performance. The accuracy of this paper is 98.5%, sensitivity 96.50, specificity 97.00%, which is more effective than other approaches. ",

                    "Software-defined network (SDN) is a new network architecture that is more manageable, adaptable, dynamic and programmable. Though the control plane is separated from the forwarding plane and it is directly programmable these make the network to become fast and easy to manage. SDN technology increases network capability and shortens the network configuration and resource management for its programmable features. For forwarding functions and centralized control, SDN supports Open-Flow technology. There are two forms of routing protocols used in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) such as Proactive routing protocol and Reactive routing protocol. The Reactive routing protocol shows the best performance than others when two communicating devices are linked with each other. In this work, Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is implemented as a reactive routing protocol in SDN and analyzes the performance based on using the most essential quality of service (QoS) metrics. Moreover, it is found that for VANET in SDN architecture, the highest packet delay is inferior to other traditional network architectures and the packet transfer rate is also high.",

Moreover, many people\nneed to move from their house for attending office, meetings, and traveling from one district to another district for\nspecial purposes. In this paperwork, a system is introduced to reduce the cost and time to send a product from one place\nto another place. Basically, an application is developed to meet the people who want to send a product and another one\nwho want to carry the product. For carrying the product one can easily earn money. After scrutinizing the cost of\ncourier services in Bangladesh, an algorithm is introduced to calculate the carrying cost of the product and an algorithm\nis also developed for product security.",

                    "Diabetes is considered one of the incurable diseases at present which is caused by hyperglycemia. Modern\nhealthcare finds some attributes such as uncontrolled lifestyle, lack of balanced diets, genetic complexities,\nexcess mental fatigue, obesities, and so on, which are responsible to precipitate the rapid mobility of diabetes\ndiseases. This is not only a single disease but it also damages the nervous systems, heart, kidney, liver, eyes,\nand various organic metabolisms. Currently, the clinical industries have a huge amount of data for the\ndiagnosis of diabetic patients. Machine learning algorithms can work appropriately to mitigate this tedious\ntask in finding hidden patterns, discovering knowledge from the database, and predict outcomes. This\nresearch has proposed an efficient machine learning-based diagnosis methodology that outperforms the\nexisting similar methodologies. The experiment selects the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance\n(mRMR) features from the working dataset and then recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique for\noptimization. The irregularity problem in the dataset is addressed by the synthetic minority oversampling\ntechnique (SMOTE). Machine learning classification is performed on the selected optimized features through\nDecision Tree (C4.5 DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NBs), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\nLogistic Regression (LGR), and Random Forest (RF), where RF classifier produces best-suited results with\nminimum false detection rate.

Generally, 4IR considered as the mixture of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other frontier technologies. It is obvious that nowadays a plethora of smart devices is providing services to make the daily life of humans easier. However, in the morning most people around the globe use a traditional mirror while preparing themselves for daily tasks. The aim is to build a low-cost intelligent mirror system that can display a variety of details based on user recommendations. Therefore, in this article, Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-based smart mirror is introduced that will support the users to receive the necessary daily update of weather information, date, time, calendar, to-do list, updated news headlines, traffic updates, COVID-19 cases status and so on. Moreover, a face detection method also implemented with the smart mirror to construct the architecture more secure. Our proposed MirrorME application provides a success rate of nearly 87% in interacting with the features of face recognition and voice input. The mirror is capable of delivering multimedia facilities while maintaining high levels of security within the device.",

In the academic field, attendance is recorded and updated manually in the teacherÃ¢ÂÂs notebook or any other application. In general, these types of systems waste time for both students and teachers. Also, other Job sectors use fingerprint attendance for arrival and departure, but the time between arrival and departure the employee can go outside anytime that he wants. So, this problem we can overcome using the unique feature of every human being on his face. In this proposed system, facial recognition technology is used to automatically take attendance. Sometimes when many people can come together. This system can able to detect multiple faces at a time. In this system, Face detection is done using DLib and ResNet-34 is used for face recognition. Using two cameras arrival and departure times of an individual are calculated sequentially. 96.03% accuracy observed by the camera-1 to recognize the face and at day time when light is off camera-2 shows the best accuracy 96.62%.",

This paper presented a home automation security system that employs the Internet of Things (IoT) for remote\naccess to one's home through an Android application, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to ensure the home's\nsecurity. Face recognition is utilized to control door entry in a highly efficient security system. In the event of a\ntechnical failure, an additional security PIN is set up that is only accessible by the owner. Although a home automation\nsystem may be used for various tasks, the cost is prohibitive for many customers. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\nprovide a budget and user-friendly system, ensuring access to the application and home attributes by using multi-modal\nsecurity.

                    "Disease diagnosis is the most critical task in the medical diagnosis system. At present, the biggest challenge\nis to predict heart disease very quickly; for that limitation, the number of dying people is increasing day by\nday. If a heart disease is diagnosed quickly, we can reduce the death rate indisputably. Thus, this research\nproduces a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that can confer a conceptual report of clear\nwarning of patient's heart condition. The proposed prediction system predicts heart disease using some health\nparameters. The system uses thirteen health parameters like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, ECG,\netc. Eight algorithms are used separately to diagnose heart disease accurately, namely KNN, XgBoost,\nLogistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ada Boost, Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, and\nRandom Forest (RF). Decision Tree and Random Forest provide better performance than others among all\nmethods. This research also established a website to easily check their heart condition from home instantly.\nThe system has used 1026 individual patients' data for training and testing. It achieves higher accuracy in the\ndifferent algorithms such as DT (99%), RF (99%), XgBoost (95%), KNN (89%), SVM (85%), LR (85%),\nAda Boost (83%) and NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (82%). The experiment result provides a target value of 0 or 1 that refers\nto the patient's presence or absence of heart disease. ",

Automatic diagnosis helps to fight against COVID-19 in community outbreaks. Medical imaging technology can reinforce disease monitoring and detection facilities with the advancement of computer vision. Unfortunately, deep learning models are facing starvation of more generalized datasets as the data repositories of COVID-19 are not rich enough to provide significant distinct features. To address the limitation, this article describes the generation of synthetic images of COVID-19 along with other chest infections with distinct features by empirical top entropy-based patch selection approach using the generative adversarial network. After that, a diagnosis is performed through a faster region-based convolutional neural network using 6,406 synthetic as well as 3,933 original chest X-ray images of different chest infections, which also addressed the data imbalance problems and not recumbent to a particular class. The experiment confirms a satisfactory COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy of 99.16% in a multi-class scenario.",

                    "Dengue fever is a severe disease spread by Aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs) in tropical areas such as Bangladesh. Since its breakout in the 1960s, dengue fever has been endemic in Bangladesh, with the highest concentration of infections in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to develop a machine learning model that can use relevant information about the factors that cause Dengue outbreaks within a geographic region. To predict dengue cases in 11 different districts of Bangladesh, we created a DengueBD dataset and employed two machine learning algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This research also explores the correlation among environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, and humidity with the rise and decline trend of Dengue cases in different cities of Bangladesh. The entire dataset was divided into an 80:20 ratio, with 80 percent used for training and 20% used for testing. The research findings imply that, for both the MLR with 67% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.57 and SVR models with 75% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.95, the number of dengue cases reduces throughout the winter season in the country and increases mainly during the rainy season in the next ten months, from August 2021 to May 2022. Importantly, Dhaka, BangladeshÃ¢ÂÂs capital, will see the maximum number of dengue patients during this period. ",

                    "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world. It is a dangerous health disorder caused by the interruption of the blood flow to the brain, resulting in severe illness, disability, or death. An accurate prediction of stroke is necessary for the early stage of treatment and overcoming the mortality rate. This study proposes a machine learning approach to diagnose stroke with imbalanced data more accurately. Random Over Sampling (ROS) technique has been used in this work to balance the data. Eleven classifiers, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, Voting Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perception, and Nearest Centroid, are analyzed in this study. Ten classifiers show more than 90% accurate results before balancing the data and four classifiers display more than 96% accurate results after data-balancing using the oversampling method. The Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed in each model to enhance the results. Moreover, Accuracy, F1-Measure, Precision, and Recall are used to measure the performance of machine learning models. The results show the Support Vector Machine has the highest accuracy of 99.99%, with recall values of 99.99%, precision values of 99.99%, and F1-measure of 99.99%. Random Forest achieves the second-highest accuracy of 99.87%, with a 0.001% error. ",

                    "Early detection and characterization are considered crucial in treating and controlling the chronic renal disease. Because of the rising number of patients, the high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the poor prognosis of morbidity and mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Detecting CKD in its early stages is critical for saving millions of lives. The uniqueness of this study lies in developing a diagnosis system to detect chronic kidney disease using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with the support of a hybrid feature selection approach. This study exploited the 400 clinical data of CKD patients based on the dataset supplied by the University of California Irvine (UCI) available at their Machine Learning repository. Different data preparation techniques like encoding categorical features, missing values imputation, removing outlier factors, handling data imbalance, scaling data at the same level, and selecting relevant features are adopted to prepare the dataset for the prediction model. A hybrid Chi-squared test (Chi2) and Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection approach is proposed to remove redundant features, and a Pearson correlation matrix is also computed to consider the top important features for the prediction. Lastly, the Extra tress classifier can diagnose CKD with 98% accuracy and a 2% true negative rate without data leakage out of 14 machine learning models.",

This pandemic disease recovery is possible if detected in the early stage. We proposed an automated deep learning approach from Computed Tomography (CT) scan images to detect COVID-19 positive patients by following a four-phase paradigm for COVID-19 detection: preprocess the CT scan images; remove noise from test image by using anisotropic diffusion techniques; make a different segment for the preprocessed images; and train and test COVID-19 detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. This study employed well-known pre-trained models, including AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16 and VGG19 to evaluate experiments. 80% of images are used to train the network in the detection process, while the remaining 20% are used to test it. The result of the experiment evaluation confirmed that the VGG19 pre-trained CNN model achieved better accuracy (98.06%).",

                    "In recent times, various forms of crime have been happening worldwide. The law-and-order department of any country officially records a crime in electronic forms or on paper when the crime is reported by a victim or someone on behalf of the victim. The document that is prepared to file any perceptible committed crimes including dowry, kidnap, murder, rape, theft, and others is called First Information Report(FIR). Nowadays, online FIR also known as e-FIR has been used worldwide. Every day a number of e-FIR are filed, and they are maintained in a centralized database with the aid of third-party trust. Consequently, malicious entities including insiders and outsidersÃ¢ÂÂ dishonest personnel, and third-party authorities may tamper with e-FIR that questions the transparency and integrity of FIR reports. To address this exposure, in this paper, we propose a blockchain based FIR system to store all kinds of offense-related records to assure security, fidelity and privacy of FIR records. In this proposed system, the blockchain technology that refers to a decentralized and distributed ledger across peer-to-peer networks continually updates the shared ledger and strictly maintains synchronization among all network nodes. Though blockchain technology guarantees tamper-proof of the data, it cannot store a large amount of data due to the replication of ledger among all network nodes. ",

                    "A central nervous system known as an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has long-term effects on a person's capacity for engagement and interaction with others. Since its symptoms often manifest in the first two years of life, autism is considered to be a behavioral condition that can be identified at any point in a person's life. This study investigated the potentiality of machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to predict ASD using some health parameters. There are 292 instances and 21 attributes in the first dataset linked to the screening for ASD in children. The adult individuals in the second dataset had a total of 704 occurrences and 21 characteristics related to ASD detection. In order to achieve the highest accuracy possible from the machine learning models, feature optimization is used in this study along with other preprocessing approaches. The findings overwhelmingly support the notion that Random Forest performs better on all of these datasets, with the greatest accuracy (100%) for data on Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children and adults, respectively.",

Breast cancer refers to a malignant neoplasm that develops from breast cells. Developed and less developed countries both are suffering from this extensive cancer. This cancer can be recuperated if it is detected at an early stage. Many researchers have proposed several machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer with the highest accuracy in the past years. In this research work, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) has been used as a training set from the UCI machine learning repository to compare the performance of the various machine learning techniques. Different kinds of machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors(K-NN), Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Nearest Cluster Classifier (NCC), and voting classifier (VC) have been used for comparing and analyzing breast cancer into benign and malignant tumors. Various matrices such as error rate, Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, and recall have been implemented to measure the model's performance. Each Algorithm's accuracy has been ascertained for finding the best suitable one. Based on the analysis, the result shows that the Voting classifier has the highest accuracy, which is 98.77%, with the lowest error rate. Finally, a web page is developed using a flask micro-framework integrating the best model using react.",

Explainable machine learning (XML) is a new approach that aims to provide transparency and interpretability for machine learning models. The entire experiment has been performed in the lung cancer dataset obtained from Kaggle. The outcome of the predictive model with ROS (Random Oversampling) class balancing technique is used to comprehend the most relevant clinical features that contributed to the prediction of lung cancer using a machine learning explainable technique termed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation). The results show the robustness of GBM's capacity to detect lung cancer, with 98.76% accuracy, 98.79% precision, 98.76% recall, 98.76% F-Measure, and 0.16% error rate, respectively.

                    "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia among older people. In addition, a considerable portion of the world's population suffers from metabolic problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. Alzheimer's disease affects the brain in a degenerative manner. As the elderly population grows, this illness can cause more people to become inactive by impairing their memory and physical functionality. This might impact their family members and the financial, economic, and social spheres. Researchers have recently investigated different machine learning and deep learning approaches to detect such diseases at an earlier stage. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD help patients to recover from it successfully and with the least harm. This paper proposes a machine learning model that comprises GaussianNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, and GradientBoost to predict Alzheimer's disease. The model is trained using the open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) dataset to evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings showed that the voting classifier attained the highest validation accuracy of 96% for the AD dataset. Therefore, ML algorithms have the potential to drastically lower Alzheimer's disease annual mortality rates through accurate detection.",

                    "Nowadays, one of the most important illnesses is a heart disease which causes most patients dead. The medical diagnosis of heart disease is quite difficult. This diagnosis is a challenging process that requires accuracy and efficiency. The chance of death will be decreased with early heart disease detection. Because cardiac problems are now a fairly frequent ailment, predicting heart disease has become one of the most difficult medical jobs in recent years. Researchers looked at a variety of closely related traits to discover the most reliable predictors of these conditions. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to identify the presence of cardiac abnormalities. The proposed method predicts the chances of heart disease and classifies patient's risk level by using different ML algorithm techniques such as Decision Tree (DT), Ada-Boost Classifier (AB), Extra trees Classifier (ET), Support vector Machine (SVM), Gradient boost, MLP, extreme gradient boost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), KNN, and LR. Three different datasets are combined to train and test the proposed system. The experimental results show that, when compared to other ML algorithms, the Decision Tree algorithm has the highest accuracy, at 99.16%.",

As a result, it may raise a variety of serious security issues. This study suggests a remote access home automation security system that incorporates utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for ensuring the security of the house. For a highly efficient security system, Face recognition has been used to maneuver the door access. In case of power outage or for any technical issues, an alternative security PIN has been added which is only accessible by the owner. Moreover, individuals are able to monitor and control the door access along with other attributes of the house using an application. In this work, Face detection is performed using the Haar Cascade classifier, while face recognition is performed using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH). 95.7% accuracy in recognizing faces has been achieved after evaluating the proposed system.",

                    "In this age of technology, the popularity, and necessity of mobile applications in the field of education are increasing day by day. Many students in Bangladesh are not able to develop as qualified due to a lack of a suitable environment and skilled teachers. This problem has been solved to a large extent through various E-Learning applications. But no research has yet been done on exactly how efficient, intuitive, and usable these applications are. Therefore, this study's objectives are to assess these E-Learning appsÃ¢ÂÂ usability in the context of Bangladesh and to offer potential architectural recommendations for improving their usability and acceptance. To accomplish the objectives, the usability of five E-Learning applications (Bacbon, Prottoy, Shikho, Classroom, and Muktopaath) developed in the context of Bangladesh was evaluated through Heuristic Evaluation and Semiotic Evaluation process. The study showed that all selected applications have several usability problems. The heuristic evaluation is based on the principle of efficiency, consistency, flexibility, conventions, and error management of each application while the semiotic evaluation upheld the intuitiveness of the interface elements of the selected applications. Finally, to enhance the usability of these applications, some sets of recommendations and implications have been presented for practitioners.\n\n",

                    "Different kinds of educational systems have been applied in learning and teaching to maximize the slope of the learning curve of the students. One of those educational systems is the OBE system or Outcome-based education. Outcome-based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world, at multiple levels. In this education system, students and teachers have a clear view of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course. However, in this education system, as many of the students are trying to get the same outcome, weak students are getting behind to achieve their goals. Hence creating inequity, the proposed work uses the prior student data to apply the Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes (CO-PO) attainment model and recommends the students to focus on their individual weaknesses. So as the students are studying through their courses, their results are recorded. Then the data of those students are used to train the application in our proposed work. Consequently, the application can identify pupils who need to learn their needed topics. As a result of this proposed method, students with different abilities can not only rely on the outcome, but also have to develop their required subjects to thrive in their learning process.",

Suitable relief, steep terrain gradients, Permiancyclothems and Pennsylvanian that weather into fine-grained soils which have extensive clay, and appropriate precipitation are present in Chittagong, Bandarban, and other hillside regions of Bangladesh. In order to map landslide susceptibility for some of the areas in Rangamati District, Bangladesh, this study compares and evaluates a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Byes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and the hybrid approaches. This studyâs combination of logistic regression and random forest demonstrated 91.1% accuracy in landslide prediction. For risk management and disaster planning, this paper provides a useful analysis for selecting the best model for determining landslide susceptibility.",

                    "Crop disease is considered as a major constraint to both food quality and production. Even in this era of precision agriculture, the lacking of compulsory infrastructure has made rapid identification of crop diseases quite hard in numerous regions around the world. In this paper, we introduced a new method based on biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) to identify prime maize leaf diseases. We performed biorthogonal wavelet decomposition and pixel wise morphological operation to segment the maize leaf lesion from input image. For feature extraction, by applying 2-D biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) at multiple levels we proposed a novel method to extract colour channel wise wavelet entropy features by investigating discriminatory potential of three different biorthogonal wavelet filters (bior3.3, bior3.5, and bior3.7). The effectiveness of our extracted features were evaluated by employing five different classifiers and obtaining 95.78% overall identification accuracy with 10-fold cross validation.",

                    "An automated fruit identification system may be used in the supermarket to help consumers determine the type and standard of fruits. Automatic fruit categorization and recognition is becoming increasingly popular, but it is also becoming more difficult due to low contrast and ambiguous characteristics. Proposed research used deep learning algorithms to classify fruit images and developed a web-based system for autonomous fruit identification. However, autonomous fruit categorization is not a relatively easy process that is dependent on the locations, shapes, colors, and sizes of the objects. Proposed study collected samples from different local places, then removed images backdrops and improved them for a more accurate result. ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and MobileNet were utilized to achieve more precise feature extraction. Among these, MobileNet achieved 99.21% accuracy in feature extraction, outperforming previously proposed machine learning techniques. 3240 samples of eight different fruits are collected from the Bangladeshi countryside, including Carambola, Bilimbi, Elephant Apple, Emblica, Burmese Grape, Sapodilla, Tamarind, and Wood Apple. As a consequence of this research, the proposed approach will aid individuals and industry in recognizing local fruits due to its high accuracy rate and web-based system.",

                    'Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common problem among people with diabetes that can result in amputation of the affected limb. Modern DFU treatment and diagnosis methods are expensive and time-consuming. Today, the development of the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method makes it possible for pathologists to diagnose DFU more swiftly and accurately. This has led to a rise in interest in deep learning (DL) approaches based on CAD. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called "DFU_MultiNet," which focuses on the transfer learning approach to classify healthy and ulcer skin images using publicly available repositories. The proposed framework is developed to offer an efficient and robust method for DFU classification that determines the distinction between healthy and ulcerated skin. The proposed approach extracts features from foot samples using three well-known pre-trained CNN models: VGG19, DenseNet201, and NasNetMobile. Finally, these extracted results are merged through a summing layer to create a powerful hybrid network. Through obtaining impressive accuracy (99.06 %), precision (100.00 %), recall (98.18 %), specificity (100.00 %), F1-score (99.08 %), and AUC (99.09 %) the proposed "DFU_MultiNet" framework holds great potential as a diagnostic tool in healthcare and clinical settings.',

As CKC does not show any earlier symptoms, the earlier prediction will be very effective to elevate its effect. In this paper, a machine learning-based method for diagnosing CKC at an early stage is proposed. SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Native Bayes, Logistic Regression, LGBM, CatBoost, and AdaBoost are employed for classification purposes, and among these algorithms, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and LGBM give 99% accuracy. Data pre-processing and feature selection help improve the accuracy of the proposed model. The outcome of the comparative analysis of our proposed work with eight existing approaches proves the robustness and supremacy of the work. Furthermore, the best model is also used to develop a user-friendly web application.",

                    "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes. Traditional techniques of DFU analysis and therapy are more time-consuming and costly. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep neural networks, has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in medical applications. Despite this, the lack of explainability of deep learning models is currently viewed as a key hurdle to using these approaches in actual clinical settings. In this research, we present the DFU_XAI framework for assessing the interpretability of explainable-driven deep learning (DL) models. DFU_XAI evaluates five DL models (Xception, DenseNet121, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2) to establish a transparent DL framework using three state-of-the-art explanation methods: Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet50 outperformed the other four models with remarkable results: 98.75% accuracy, 99.2% precision, 97.6% recall, 98.4% F1-score, and 98.5% AUC. For the most part, it can locate diabetic foot ulcers precisely on a diabetic foot and discriminate between diabetic foot ulcers and healthy feet in the DFU dataset. A heat map will indicate the precise location of the ulcer that needs care. ",

                    "The third most common disease in the world that leads to mortality is colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonoscopy, which locates and removes colonic polyps, is the most common procedure worldwide for the early identification and preventative treatment of colorectal cancer. The likelihood of a CRC patient dying can be considerably decreased by early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous polyps. Unidentified polyps may eventually turn into cancer. Although several classification algorithms have been put out to identify polyps, their effectiveness has not yet been compared to that of skilled endoscopes. An ensemble machine learning-based classification approach for detecting colorectal cancer from colonoscopy images is presented in this research. Firstly researchers collect colorectal cancer or polyp images from three standard datasets. In the preprocessing phase, researcher convert the RGB image to grayscale image and identified the region of interest (ROI) by removing the unwanted regions. A hybrid anisotropic diffusion filtering (HADF) approach was employed to eliminate noise from each image. Then the system extracts features from individual feature extractor methods and fused extracted features in a vector. The fused features help to detect colorectal polyp or cancer for increasing cancer or polyp identification rates. Finally, an ensemble classifier classifies the colorectal cancer or normal images and achieves better accuracy. The suggested technique exceeds the prior conventional methods, according to tests on widely used public datasets, improving accuracy by 99.45 %, sensitivity by 99.30 %, specificityby 99.58 %, and precision 99.53 %.",

After authentication it extends to the design of a blockchain-based voting scheme, powered by smart contracts and NEAR wallet integration. This innovative model constructs a robust and secure blockchain-based e-voting solution. This research represents a significant step towards achieving a balance between the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic voting schemes while upholding the integrity and privacy crucial to the democratic process.",

                    "Perinatal asphyxia is one of the top three causes of neonatal death in developing countries, killing over 1.2 million newborns yearly. Asphyxia cannot be definitively diagnosed early on visually or physically; instead, it can only be diagnosed medically. In this research, an ensemble machine learning-based approach is proposed to detect infant asphyxia at the early stage. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which divide each featureâs values into the time domain and the frequency domain, were originally used in the technique to evaluate feature extraction methodologies. Unwanted noise, outliers, missing numbers, label encoding, and other difficulties are eliminated using pre-processing techniques. By applying the random oversampling (ROS) method, data balance is achieved. After analyzing and evaluating the performance of the proposed model, it is observed that the highest accuracy 99.29% is obtained using the combination of logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor with a 0.007% rate of error.",

In healthcare, especially cardiology, it is crucial to accurately and quickly diagnose cardiac problems. In this research, we proposed an accurate and efficient mobile application-based system for diagnosing cardiac disease based on machine learning approaches. The developed mobile application is voice assistive, which makes the proposed application more user-friendly. Numerous machine learning methods have been examined in this study to predict and diagnose cardiovascular disease (CVD). A detailed comparative study was also drawn using eighteen (18) classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGB, LGBM, Extra Trees Perceptron, and Voting Classifier (hard or soft voting). Sixty-eight thousand nine hundred seventy-five (68,975) samples from various patients were used to test the performance of each approach. According to the study, Random Forest and Decision Trees have the best accuracy levels at 99.9%. However, the Support Vector Machine classifier had the lowest performance, barely achieving 60% accuracy.",

                    "Chronic liver damage is believed to be mostly caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). About 90% of hepatitis C infections progress to chronic hepatitis. Acute HCV infection is a condition that frequently progresses to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer; therefore, understanding this stage of the virus is essential. Molecular and serological testing approaches are often expensive and difficult to perform for diagnosing HCV infection. Machine learning technology can be effectively employed to identify patterns or associations for diagnosing HCV infection. The study utilized machine learning techniques to develop classification models for hepatitis C illness, aiming to anticipate the virus responsible for the infection. Our research integrates various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Cat Boost, Bagging Classifier, SGD Classifier, Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB, Multinomial NB, Linear Discriminant Analysis, ANN, and MLP. Prior to training the models, preprocessing methods, including normalization, filtering, and SMOTE, were used to improve the datasetÃ¢ÂÂs attributes. The classification accuracy scores show encouraging results, with ANN scoring 79.63%, MLP scoring 46.29%, Bernoulli NB scoring 79.62%, Cat Boost scoring 98.14%, and Random Forest scoring 99.53%. Among classification methods, random forest demonstrates the highest accuracy in diagnosing HCV infection.",

Several techniques, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, AdaBoost, and Logistic regression, were applied to find the most reliable factor for ovarian cancer prediction. A clinically evaluated raw dataset of benign samples and malignant ovarian tumor patient data set is used to develop early-stage ovarian cancer predictions, and the effectiveness of ML models was examined utilizing metrics including F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The proposed study shows better outcomes, with the Random Forest classifier exhibiting the highest accuracy for validation at 99% based on the test data of ovarian cancer predictions.

                    "Cancer patients can benefit from early detection and diagnosis. This study proposes a machine vision strategy for detecting breast cancer in ultrasound images and correcting several ultrasound difficulties such artifacts, speckle noise, and blurring. In quantitative evolution, edge preservation criteria were discovered to be superior to standard ones for hybrid anisotropic diffusion. A learnable super-resolution (SR) is inserted in the deep CNN to dig for extra possible information. The feature is fused with a pre-trained deep CNN model utilizing Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Machine learning (ML) techniques that are used to create these recommendation systems require well-balanced data in terms of class distribution, however most datasets in the real world are imbalanced. Imbalanced data forces a classifier to concentrate on the majority class while ignoring other classes of interest, lowering the predicted performance of any classification model. We propose a generative adversarial networks (GAN) strategy to overcome the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems in this research. Standard data is used to train this model, which assures a high level of resolution. In the testing phase, generalized data of varied resolution is used to evaluate the model's performance. It is discovered through cross-validation that a 5-fold method can successfully eliminate the overfitting problem. With an accuracy of 99.48 %, this suggested feature fusion technique indicates satisfactory performance when compared to current related works. Finally finding cancer region, researcher used U-Net architecture and extract cancer region from BC ultrasound images.",

                    "Thyroid issues are becoming more and more common, and early detection is critical for therapy that reduces mortality and complications. Because of these factors, detecting thyroid problems has become more crucial in the medical field. Estimating the course of a disease accurately and understanding how clinical features interact are critical for medical diagnosis and treatment. All of these limits are overcome in our study by using a standard machine-learning model with proper clinical feature analysis and an ensemble-learning technique. Predicting sickness progression and the interdependence of clinical features or aspects are critical in medical diagnosis and therapy. However, machine learning has enabled us to detect the risk factors for this sickness. To select the best thyroid prediction outcome, we used five machine learning models in addition to the Ensemble ML classifier (hard voting). Class balancing approaches greatly increase classification performance. It has been demonstrated that using random oversampling improves classification results dramatically. Based on the experimental data, our suggested model outperforms existing methods by a wide margin. Using the XGBoost and SelectKBest feature selection strategies, the Ensemble ML classifier achieves the best results on hard voting on RF and DT, with 100â¯% sensitivity and 99.71â¯% accuracy. When features are decreased and the issue of high-class imbalance is addressed, the ensemble ML classifier (hard voting) performs better in dealing with classification challenges.",

                    "Cervical cancer has recently emerged as the leading cause of premature death among women. Around 85% of cervical cancer cases occur in underdeveloped countries. There are several risk factors associated with cervical cancer. This study describes a novel predictive model that uses early screening and risk trends from individual health records to forecast cervical cancer patients' prognoses. This study uses machine learning classification techniques to investigate the risk factors for cervical cancer. Additionally, use the voting method to evaluate all models and select the most appropriate model. The dataset used in this study contains missing values and shows a significant imbalance. Thus, the Random Oversampling technique was used as a sampling method. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and XGBoost feature selection techniques to determine the most important features. To predict the accuracy, we used several machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AdB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). To demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested model, a comparison of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was performed. We used the Random Oversampling approach along with the Ensemble ML method, hard voting on RF and MLP, and achieved 99.19% accuracy. It is demonstrated that the ensemble ML classifier (hard voting) performs better at handling classification problems when features are decreased and the high-class imbalance problem is handled.",

                    "Since the world's population is rising continuously, more cultivable land is being utilized for their dwellings. As a result, the amount of food supply is decreasing day by day. In order to address the food shortage, a proper plan and technological breakthroughs is must. Tomato is a kind of vegetable which has the healthy ingredients and essential for our daily food list. The proposed system suggests an IoT based tomato cultivation and pest management system, with the help of deep learning methods. In the IoT implementation, camera module and moisture sensor are used to collect images of tomato plant, soil condition respectively. Based on the moisture content, the water pump will supply the water when it necessary. Besides, the real-time images of tomato leaf will be sent to the server to identify and classify natural enemies like various insect species. In the proposed system seven types of pests are identified with the help of ten deep learning models like InceptionV3, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Large, MobileNetV3Small, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201. This study has trained with leaves and insects separately to identify whether an image from a tomato plant is insectoid or not. 458 images of pests and 912 images of leaves are utilized in the proposed architecture. The accuracy of classifying insects or leaves using DenseNet201 is 100 â%. The highest accuracy of 94 â% is obtained to classify the different insects using the DenseNet201 model.",

                    "Air is one of the most significant elements of the environment. The increasing global air pollution crisis poses an unavoidable threat to human health, environmental sustainability, ecosystems, and the earth's climate. Air pollution has been referred to as a silent killer due to its insidious nature. Its indirect impact on human health further underscores its dangerous effects. Early detection of air quality can potentially save millions of lives globally. A unique and transformative approach can harness the power of machine learning to combat air pollution. This research presents a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that provides real-time alerts on air quality status and can help prevent premature deaths, chronic diseases, and other health problems. Air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM 2.5), are used in this study for feature analysis and extraction. The system utilizes publicly available data from 23,463 different cities worldwide. Data preprocessing was performed before feeding the data into the machine learning models for feature correlation and evaluation. The proposed research uses various machine learning models to predict air quality, including Random Forest (100%), Logistic Regression (79%), Decision Tree (100%), Support Vector Machine (93%), Linear SVC (98%), K-Nearest Neighbor (99%), and Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes (52%). A user-friendly Django-based web interface offers an accessible platform for users to monitor air quality in real-time, based on the two best-performing models: Random Forest and Decision Tree techniques.",

                    "Through the advancement of the contemporary web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, for example, life has become much easier when dealing with certain highly personal problems. The far-reaching consequences of online harassment require immediate preventative steps to safeguard psychological wellness and scholarly achievement via detection at an earlier stage. This piece of writing aims to eliminate online harassment and create a criticism-free online environment. In the paper, we have used a variety of attributes to evaluate a large number of Bengali comments. We communicate cleansed data utilizing machine learning (ML) methods and natural language processing techniques, which must be followed using term frequency and reverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a count vectorizer. In addition, we used tokenization with padding to feed our deep learning (DL) models. Using mathematical visualization and natural language processing, online bullying could be detected quickly. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression Classifier (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Bagging Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Voting Classifier, and Stacking are employed in the research we conducted. We expanded our investigation to include different DL frameworks. Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (C-LSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are all implemented. A large amount of data is required to precisely recognize harassing behavior. To rapidly recognize internet harassment written material, we combined two sets of data, producing 94,000 Bengali comments from different points of view. After understanding the ML and DL models, we can see that a hybrid model (MLP+SGD+LR) performed more effectively when compared to other models, its evaluation accuracy is 99.34%, precision is 99.34%, recall rate is 99.33%, and F1 score is 99.34% on multi-label class. For the binary classification model, we got 99.41% of accuracy.",

                    "Cardiovascular disease is currently a prominent sickness that kills the majority of sufferers. The medical evaluation of cardiac disease presents significant problems. This diagnostic method is complex, requiring precision and efficiency. Early detection of heart disease can significantly lower the chance of death. In light of the high occurrence of cardiac issues in contemporary times, the prediction of heart disease has emerged as one of the most challenging endeavors within the medical field in recent years. Scientists examined a plethora of closely related characteristics to identify the most trustworthy predictors of these diseases. In this work, we use Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect the existence of cardiac problems. The suggested method predicts the likelihood of heart disease and classifies people into risk categories. This is performed by utilizing several machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR). The developed system is trained and evaluated using a composite dataset derived from two separate sources. The results of the experiments show that, when compared to other machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest approach achieves the greatest accuracy rate, achieving an amazing 99.99%.",

                    "Lung cancer is the overgrowth of cells in digestive organs. Identifying different types of lung cancer (squamous cell cancer, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) from lung histopathological images is outrageous works that shorten the chance of infected with lung cancer in the future. This research propounds an accurate diagnosis scheme using various neural network features and fusion of contourlet transform from lung histopathological image. This lesson has used several pre-train models (Alexnet, ResNet50, and VGG-16) in addition to divers scratch models while the pre-train Resnet50 model works better. The two reduction techniques (Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR)) have used to classify the type of lung cancer with the extraction of the most significant properties. In Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based lung cancer detection, the reduction approach PCA performs better. This proposed methodology is performed on ordinary datasets and establishes comparative better performance. The accuracy of this paper is 98.5%, sensitivity 96.50, specificity 97.00%, which is more effective than other approaches. ",

                    "Software-defined network (SDN) is a new network architecture that is more manageable, adaptable, dynamic and programmable. Though the control plane is separated from the forwarding plane and it is directly programmable these make the network to become fast and easy to manage. SDN technology increases network capability and shortens the network configuration and resource management for its programmable features. For forwarding functions and centralized control, SDN supports Open-Flow technology. There are two forms of routing protocols used in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) such as Proactive routing protocol and Reactive routing protocol. The Reactive routing protocol shows the best performance than others when two communicating devices are linked with each other. In this work, Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is implemented as a reactive routing protocol in SDN and analyzes the performance based on using the most essential quality of service (QoS) metrics. Moreover, it is found that for VANET in SDN architecture, the highest packet delay is inferior to other traditional network architectures and the packet transfer rate is also high.",

                    "Diabetes is considered one of the incurable diseases at present which is caused by hyperglycemia. Modern\nhealthcare finds some attributes such as uncontrolled lifestyle, lack of balanced diets, genetic complexities,\nexcess mental fatigue, obesities, and so on, which are responsible to precipitate the rapid mobility of diabetes\ndiseases. This is not only a single disease but it also damages the nervous systems, heart, kidney, liver, eyes,\nand various organic metabolisms. Currently, the clinical industries have a huge amount of data for the\ndiagnosis of diabetic patients. Machine learning algorithms can work appropriately to mitigate this tedious\ntask in finding hidden patterns, discovering knowledge from the database, and predict outcomes. This\nresearch has proposed an efficient machine learning-based diagnosis methodology that outperforms the\nexisting similar methodologies. The experiment selects the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance\n(mRMR) features from the working dataset and then recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique for\noptimization. The irregularity problem in the dataset is addressed by the synthetic minority oversampling\ntechnique (SMOTE). Machine learning classification is performed on the selected optimized features through\nDecision Tree (C4.5 DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NBs), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\nLogistic Regression (LGR), and Random Forest (RF), where RF classifier produces best-suited results with\nminimum false detection rate.

                    "We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry 4.0. Generally, 4IR considered as the mixture of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other frontier technologies. It is obvious that nowadays a plethora of smart devices is providing services to make the daily life of humans easier. However, in the morning most people around the globe use a traditional mirror while preparing themselves for daily tasks. The aim is to build a low-cost intelligent mirror system that can display a variety of details based on user recommendations. Therefore, in this article, Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-based smart mirror is introduced that will support the users to receive the necessary daily update of weather information, date, time, calendar, to-do list, updated news headlines, traffic updates, COVID-19 cases status and so on. Moreover, a face detection method also implemented with the smart mirror to construct the architecture more secure. Our proposed MirrorME application provides a success rate of nearly 87% in interacting with the features of face recognition and voice input. The mirror is capable of delivering multimedia facilities while maintaining high levels of security within the device.",

                    "The attendance system is important for school, college, university, office, and factory. In the academic field, attendance is recorded and updated manually in the teacherÃ¢ÂÂs notebook or any other application. In general, these types of systems waste time for both students and teachers. Also, other Job sectors use fingerprint attendance for arrival and departure, but the time between arrival and departure the employee can go outside anytime that he wants. So, this problem we can overcome using the unique feature of every human being on his face. In this proposed system, facial recognition technology is used to automatically take attendance. Sometimes when many people can come together. This system can able to detect multiple faces at a time. In this system, Face detection is done using DLib and ResNet-34 is used for face recognition. Using two cameras arrival and departure times of an individual are calculated sequentially. 96.03% accuracy observed by the camera-1 to recognize the face and at day time when light is off camera-2 shows the best accuracy 96.62%.",

                    " In this fast-paced technological world, individuals want to access all their electronic equipment remotely,\nwhich requires devices to connect over a network via the Internet. However, it raises quite a lot of critical security\nconcerns. This paper presented a home automation security system that employs the Internet of Things (IoT) for remote\naccess to one's home through an Android application, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to ensure the home's\nsecurity. Face recognition is utilized to control door entry in a highly efficient security system. In the event of a\ntechnical failure, an additional security PIN is set up that is only accessible by the owner. Although a home automation\nsystem may be used for various tasks, the cost is prohibitive for many customers. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\nprovide a budget and user-friendly system, ensuring access to the application and home attributes by using multi-modal\nsecurity. Using Haar Cascade and LBPH the system achieved 92.86% accuracy while recognizing face.",

                    "Disease diagnosis is the most critical task in the medical diagnosis system. At present, the biggest challenge\nis to predict heart disease very quickly; for that limitation, the number of dying people is increasing day by\nday. If a heart disease is diagnosed quickly, we can reduce the death rate indisputably. Thus, this research\nproduces a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that can confer a conceptual report of clear\nwarning of patient's heart condition. The proposed prediction system predicts heart disease using some health\nparameters. The system uses thirteen health parameters like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, ECG,\netc. Eight algorithms are used separately to diagnose heart disease accurately, namely KNN, XgBoost,\nLogistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ada Boost, Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, and\nRandom Forest (RF). Decision Tree and Random Forest provide better performance than others among all\nmethods. This research also established a website to easily check their heart condition from home instantly.\nThe system has used 1026 individual patients' data for training and testing. It achieves higher accuracy in the\ndifferent algorithms such as DT (99%), RF (99%), XgBoost (95%), KNN (89%), SVM (85%), LR (85%),\nAda Boost (83%) and NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (82%). The experiment result provides a target value of 0 or 1 that refers\nto the patient's presence or absence of heart disease. ",

Automatic diagnosis helps to fight against COVID-19 in community outbreaks. Medical imaging technology can reinforce disease monitoring and detection facilities with the advancement of computer vision. Unfortunately, deep learning models are facing starvation of more generalized datasets as the data repositories of COVID-19 are not rich enough to provide significant distinct features. To address the limitation, this article describes the generation of synthetic images of COVID-19 along with other chest infections with distinct features by empirical top entropy-based patch selection approach using the generative adversarial network. After that, a diagnosis is performed through a faster region-based convolutional neural network using 6,406 synthetic as well as 3,933 original chest X-ray images of different chest infections, which also addressed the data imbalance problems and not recumbent to a particular class. The experiment confirms a satisfactory COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy of 99.16% in a multi-class scenario.",

                    "Dengue fever is a severe disease spread by Aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs) in tropical areas such as Bangladesh. Since its breakout in the 1960s, dengue fever has been endemic in Bangladesh, with the highest concentration of infections in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to develop a machine learning model that can use relevant information about the factors that cause Dengue outbreaks within a geographic region. To predict dengue cases in 11 different districts of Bangladesh, we created a DengueBD dataset and employed two machine learning algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This research also explores the correlation among environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, and humidity with the rise and decline trend of Dengue cases in different cities of Bangladesh. The entire dataset was divided into an 80:20 ratio, with 80 percent used for training and 20% used for testing. The research findings imply that, for both the MLR with 67% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.57 and SVR models with 75% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.95, the number of dengue cases reduces throughout the winter season in the country and increases mainly during the rainy season in the next ten months, from August 2021 to May 2022. Importantly, Dhaka, BangladeshÃ¢ÂÂs capital, will see the maximum number of dengue patients during this period. ",

                    "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world. It is a dangerous health disorder caused by the interruption of the blood flow to the brain, resulting in severe illness, disability, or death. An accurate prediction of stroke is necessary for the early stage of treatment and overcoming the mortality rate. This study proposes a machine learning approach to diagnose stroke with imbalanced data more accurately. Random Over Sampling (ROS) technique has been used in this work to balance the data. Eleven classifiers, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, Voting Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perception, and Nearest Centroid, are analyzed in this study. Ten classifiers show more than 90% accurate results before balancing the data and four classifiers display more than 96% accurate results after data-balancing using the oversampling method. The Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed in each model to enhance the results. Moreover, Accuracy, F1-Measure, Precision, and Recall are used to measure the performance of machine learning models. The results show the Support Vector Machine has the highest accuracy of 99.99%, with recall values of 99.99%, precision values of 99.99%, and F1-measure of 99.99%. Random Forest achieves the second-highest accuracy of 99.87%, with a 0.001% error. ",

                    "Early detection and characterization are considered crucial in treating and controlling the chronic renal disease. Because of the rising number of patients, the high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the poor prognosis of morbidity and mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Detecting CKD in its early stages is critical for saving millions of lives. The uniqueness of this study lies in developing a diagnosis system to detect chronic kidney disease using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with the support of a hybrid feature selection approach. This study exploited the 400 clinical data of CKD patients based on the dataset supplied by the University of California Irvine (UCI) available at their Machine Learning repository. Different data preparation techniques like encoding categorical features, missing values imputation, removing outlier factors, handling data imbalance, scaling data at the same level, and selecting relevant features are adopted to prepare the dataset for the prediction model. A hybrid Chi-squared test (Chi2) and Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection approach is proposed to remove redundant features, and a Pearson correlation matrix is also computed to consider the top important features for the prediction. Lastly, the Extra tress classifier can diagnose CKD with 98% accuracy and a 2% true negative rate without data leakage out of 14 machine learning models.",

This pandemic disease recovery is possible if detected in the early stage. We proposed an automated deep learning approach from Computed Tomography (CT) scan images to detect COVID-19 positive patients by following a four-phase paradigm for COVID-19 detection: preprocess the CT scan images; remove noise from test image by using anisotropic diffusion techniques; make a different segment for the preprocessed images; and train and test COVID-19 detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. This study employed well-known pre-trained models, including AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16 and VGG19 to evaluate experiments. 80% of images are used to train the network in the detection process, while the remaining 20% are used to test it. The result of the experiment evaluation confirmed that the VGG19 pre-trained CNN model achieved better accuracy (98.06%).",

                    "In recent times, various forms of crime have been happening worldwide. The law-and-order department of any country officially records a crime in electronic forms or on paper when the crime is reported by a victim or someone on behalf of the victim. The document that is prepared to file any perceptible committed crimes including dowry, kidnap, murder, rape, theft, and others is called First Information Report(FIR). Nowadays, online FIR also known as e-FIR has been used worldwide. Every day a number of e-FIR are filed, and they are maintained in a centralized database with the aid of third-party trust. Consequently, malicious entities including insiders and outsidersÃ¢ÂÂ dishonest personnel, and third-party authorities may tamper with e-FIR that questions the transparency and integrity of FIR reports. To address this exposure, in this paper, we propose a blockchain based FIR system to store all kinds of offense-related records to assure security, fidelity and privacy of FIR records. In this proposed system, the blockchain technology that refers to a decentralized and distributed ledger across peer-to-peer networks continually updates the shared ledger and strictly maintains synchronization among all network nodes. Though blockchain technology guarantees tamper-proof of the data, it cannot store a large amount of data due to the replication of ledger among all network nodes. ",

                    "A central nervous system known as an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has long-term effects on a person's capacity for engagement and interaction with others. Since its symptoms often manifest in the first two years of life, autism is considered to be a behavioral condition that can be identified at any point in a person's life. This study investigated the potentiality of machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to predict ASD using some health parameters. There are 292 instances and 21 attributes in the first dataset linked to the screening for ASD in children. The adult individuals in the second dataset had a total of 704 occurrences and 21 characteristics related to ASD detection. In order to achieve the highest accuracy possible from the machine learning models, feature optimization is used in this study along with other preprocessing approaches. The findings overwhelmingly support the notion that Random Forest performs better on all of these datasets, with the greatest accuracy (100%) for data on Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children and adults, respectively.",

                    "Breast cancer disease is recognized as one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide after lung cancer. Breast cancer refers to a malignant neoplasm that develops from breast cells. Developed and less developed countries both are suffering from this extensive cancer. This cancer can be recuperated if it is detected at an early stage. Many researchers have proposed several machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer with the highest accuracy in the past years. In this research work, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) has been used as a training set from the UCI machine learning repository to compare the performance of the various machine learning techniques. Different kinds of machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors(K-NN), Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Nearest Cluster Classifier (NCC), and voting classifier (VC) have been used for comparing and analyzing breast cancer into benign and malignant tumors. Various matrices such as error rate, Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, and recall have been implemented to measure the model's performance. Each Algorithm's accuracy has been ascertained for finding the best suitable one. Based on the analysis, the result shows that the Voting classifier has the highest accuracy, which is 98.77%, with the lowest error rate. Finally, a web page is developed using a flask micro-framework integrating the best model using react.",

                    "Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer can greatly improve the chances of survival for patients. Machine learning has been increasingly used in the medical sector for the detection of lung cancer, but the lack of interpretability of these models remains a significant challenge. Explainable machine learning (XML) is a new approach that aims to provide transparency and interpretability for machine learning models. The entire experiment has been performed in the lung cancer dataset obtained from Kaggle. The outcome of the predictive model with ROS (Random Oversampling) class balancing technique is used to comprehend the most relevant clinical features that contributed to the prediction of lung cancer using a machine learning explainable technique termed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation). The results show the robustness of GBM's capacity to detect lung cancer, with 98.76% accuracy, 98.79% precision, 98.76% recall, 98.76% F-Measure, and 0.16% error rate, respectively.

                    "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia among older people. In addition, a considerable portion of the world's population suffers from metabolic problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. Alzheimer's disease affects the brain in a degenerative manner. As the elderly population grows, this illness can cause more people to become inactive by impairing their memory and physical functionality. This might impact their family members and the financial, economic, and social spheres. Researchers have recently investigated different machine learning and deep learning approaches to detect such diseases at an earlier stage. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD help patients to recover from it successfully and with the least harm. This paper proposes a machine learning model that comprises GaussianNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, and GradientBoost to predict Alzheimer's disease. The model is trained using the open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) dataset to evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings showed that the voting classifier attained the highest validation accuracy of 96% for the AD dataset. Therefore, ML algorithms have the potential to drastically lower Alzheimer's disease annual mortality rates through accurate detection.",

                    "Nowadays, one of the most important illnesses is a heart disease which causes most patients dead. The medical diagnosis of heart disease is quite difficult. This diagnosis is a challenging process that requires accuracy and efficiency. The chance of death will be decreased with early heart disease detection. Because cardiac problems are now a fairly frequent ailment, predicting heart disease has become one of the most difficult medical jobs in recent years. Researchers looked at a variety of closely related traits to discover the most reliable predictors of these conditions. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to identify the presence of cardiac abnormalities. The proposed method predicts the chances of heart disease and classifies patient's risk level by using different ML algorithm techniques such as Decision Tree (DT), Ada-Boost Classifier (AB), Extra trees Classifier (ET), Support vector Machine (SVM), Gradient boost, MLP, extreme gradient boost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), KNN, and LR. Three different datasets are combined to train and test the proposed system. The experimental results show that, when compared to other ML algorithms, the Decision Tree algorithm has the highest accuracy, at 99.16%.",

This study suggests a remote access home automation security system that incorporates utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for ensuring the security of the house. For a highly efficient security system, Face recognition has been used to maneuver the door access. In case of power outage or for any technical issues, an alternative security PIN has been added which is only accessible by the owner. Moreover, individuals are able to monitor and control the door access along with other attributes of the house using an application. In this work, Face detection is performed using the Haar Cascade classifier, while face recognition is performed using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH). 95.7% accuracy in recognizing faces has been achieved after evaluating the proposed system.",

                    "In this age of technology, the popularity, and necessity of mobile applications in the field of education are increasing day by day. Many students in Bangladesh are not able to develop as qualified due to a lack of a suitable environment and skilled teachers. This problem has been solved to a large extent through various E-Learning applications. But no research has yet been done on exactly how efficient, intuitive, and usable these applications are. Therefore, this study's objectives are to assess these E-Learning appsÃ¢ÂÂ usability in the context of Bangladesh and to offer potential architectural recommendations for improving their usability and acceptance. To accomplish the objectives, the usability of five E-Learning applications (Bacbon, Prottoy, Shikho, Classroom, and Muktopaath) developed in the context of Bangladesh was evaluated through Heuristic Evaluation and Semiotic Evaluation process. The study showed that all selected applications have several usability problems. The heuristic evaluation is based on the principle of efficiency, consistency, flexibility, conventions, and error management of each application while the semiotic evaluation upheld the intuitiveness of the interface elements of the selected applications. Finally, to enhance the usability of these applications, some sets of recommendations and implications have been presented for practitioners.\n\n",

                    "Different kinds of educational systems have been applied in learning and teaching to maximize the slope of the learning curve of the students. One of those educational systems is the OBE system or Outcome-based education. Outcome-based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world, at multiple levels. In this education system, students and teachers have a clear view of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course. However, in this education system, as many of the students are trying to get the same outcome, weak students are getting behind to achieve their goals. Hence creating inequity, the proposed work uses the prior student data to apply the Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes (CO-PO) attainment model and recommends the students to focus on their individual weaknesses. So as the students are studying through their courses, their results are recorded. Then the data of those students are used to train the application in our proposed work. Consequently, the application can identify pupils who need to learn their needed topics. As a result of this proposed method, students with different abilities can not only rely on the outcome, but also have to develop their required subjects to thrive in their learning process.",

Suitable relief, steep terrain gradients, Permiancyclothems and Pennsylvanian that weather into fine-grained soils which have extensive clay, and appropriate precipitation are present in Chittagong, Bandarban, and other hillside regions of Bangladesh. In order to map landslide susceptibility for some of the areas in Rangamati District, Bangladesh, this study compares and evaluates a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Byes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and the hybrid approaches. This studyâs combination of logistic regression and random forest demonstrated 91.1% accuracy in landslide prediction. For risk management and disaster planning, this paper provides a useful analysis for selecting the best model for determining landslide susceptibility.",

                    "Crop disease is considered as a major constraint to both food quality and production. Even in this era of precision agriculture, the lacking of compulsory infrastructure has made rapid identification of crop diseases quite hard in numerous regions around the world. In this paper, we introduced a new method based on biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) to identify prime maize leaf diseases. We performed biorthogonal wavelet decomposition and pixel wise morphological operation to segment the maize leaf lesion from input image. For feature extraction, by applying 2-D biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) at multiple levels we proposed a novel method to extract colour channel wise wavelet entropy features by investigating discriminatory potential of three different biorthogonal wavelet filters (bior3.3, bior3.5, and bior3.7). The effectiveness of our extracted features were evaluated by employing five different classifiers and obtaining 95.78% overall identification accuracy with 10-fold cross validation.",

                    "An automated fruit identification system may be used in the supermarket to help consumers determine the type and standard of fruits. Automatic fruit categorization and recognition is becoming increasingly popular, but it is also becoming more difficult due to low contrast and ambiguous characteristics. Proposed research used deep learning algorithms to classify fruit images and developed a web-based system for autonomous fruit identification. However, autonomous fruit categorization is not a relatively easy process that is dependent on the locations, shapes, colors, and sizes of the objects. Proposed study collected samples from different local places, then removed images backdrops and improved them for a more accurate result. ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and MobileNet were utilized to achieve more precise feature extraction. Among these, MobileNet achieved 99.21% accuracy in feature extraction, outperforming previously proposed machine learning techniques. 3240 samples of eight different fruits are collected from the Bangladeshi countryside, including Carambola, Bilimbi, Elephant Apple, Emblica, Burmese Grape, Sapodilla, Tamarind, and Wood Apple. As a consequence of this research, the proposed approach will aid individuals and industry in recognizing local fruits due to its high accuracy rate and web-based system.",

                    'Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common problem among people with diabetes that can result in amputation of the affected limb. Modern DFU treatment and diagnosis methods are expensive and time-consuming. Today, the development of the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method makes it possible for pathologists to diagnose DFU more swiftly and accurately. This has led to a rise in interest in deep learning (DL) approaches based on CAD. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called "DFU_MultiNet," which focuses on the transfer learning approach to classify healthy and ulcer skin images using publicly available repositories. The proposed framework is developed to offer an efficient and robust method for DFU classification that determines the distinction between healthy and ulcerated skin. The proposed approach extracts features from foot samples using three well-known pre-trained CNN models: VGG19, DenseNet201, and NasNetMobile. Finally, these extracted results are merged through a summing layer to create a powerful hybrid network. Through obtaining impressive accuracy (99.06 %), precision (100.00 %), recall (98.18 %), specificity (100.00 %), F1-score (99.08 %), and AUC (99.09 %) the proposed "DFU_MultiNet" framework holds great potential as a diagnostic tool in healthcare and clinical settings.',

                    "Chronic Kidney Cancer (CKC) is a disease that hindrances the blood-filtering mechanism of the kidney and is increasing at an alarming rate in the recent few years. As CKC does not show any earlier symptoms, the earlier prediction will be very effective to elevate its effect. In this paper, a machine learning-based method for diagnosing CKC at an early stage is proposed. SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Native Bayes, Logistic Regression, LGBM, CatBoost, and AdaBoost are employed for classification purposes, and among these algorithms, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and LGBM give 99% accuracy. Data pre-processing and feature selection help improve the accuracy of the proposed model. The outcome of the comparative analysis of our proposed work with eight existing approaches proves the robustness and supremacy of the work. Furthermore, the best model is also used to develop a user-friendly web application.",

                  paperAbstract:
                    "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes. Traditional techniques of DFU analysis and therapy are more time-consuming and costly. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep neural networks, has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in medical applications. Despite this, the lack of explainability of deep learning models is currently viewed as a key hurdle to using these approaches in actual clinical settings. In this research, we present the DFU_XAI framework for assessing the interpretability of explainable-driven deep learning (DL) models. DFU_XAI evaluates five DL models (Xception, DenseNet121, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2) to establish a transparent DL framework using three state-of-the-art explanation methods: Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet50 outperformed the other four models with remarkable results: 98.75% accuracy, 99.2% precision, 97.6% recall, 98.4% F1-score, and 98.5% AUC. For the most part, it can locate diabetic foot ulcers precisely on a diabetic foot and discriminate between diabetic foot ulcers and healthy feet in the DFU dataset. A heat map will indicate the precise location of the ulcer that needs care. ",

                    "The third most common disease in the world that leads to mortality is colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonoscopy, which locates and removes colonic polyps, is the most common procedure worldwide for the early identification and preventative treatment of colorectal cancer. The likelihood of a CRC patient dying can be considerably decreased by early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous polyps. Unidentified polyps may eventually turn into cancer. Although several classification algorithms have been put out to identify polyps, their effectiveness has not yet been compared to that of skilled endoscopes. An ensemble machine learning-based classification approach for detecting colorectal cancer from colonoscopy images is presented in this research. Firstly researchers collect colorectal cancer or polyp images from three standard datasets. In the preprocessing phase, researcher convert the RGB image to grayscale image and identified the region of interest (ROI) by removing the unwanted regions. A hybrid anisotropic diffusion filtering (HADF) approach was employed to eliminate noise from each image. Then the system extracts features from individual feature extractor methods and fused extracted features in a vector. The fused features help to detect colorectal polyp or cancer for increasing cancer or polyp identification rates. Finally, an ensemble classifier classifies the colorectal cancer or normal images and achieves better accuracy. The suggested technique exceeds the prior conventional methods, according to tests on widely used public datasets, improving accuracy by 99.45 %, sensitivity by 99.30 %, specificityby 99.58 %, and precision 99.53 %.",

In this research, a novel approach is presented that leverages deep hybrid learning techniques to enhance the biometric authentication system, combining various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors with deep learning architectures including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, and Inception. After authentication it extends to the design of a blockchain-based voting scheme, powered by smart contracts and NEAR wallet integration. This innovative model constructs a robust and secure blockchain-based e-voting solution.

Asphyxia cannot be definitively diagnosed early on visually or physically; instead, it can only be diagnosed medically. In this research, an ensemble machine learning-based approach is proposed to detect infant asphyxia at the early stage. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which divide each featureâs values into the time domain and the frequency domain, were originally used in the technique to evaluate feature extraction methodologies. Unwanted noise, outliers, missing numbers, label encoding, and other difficulties are eliminated using pre-processing techniques. By applying the random oversampling (ROS) method, data balance is achieved. After analyzing and evaluating the performance of the proposed model, it is observed that the highest accuracy 99.29% is obtained using the combination of logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor with a 0.007% rate of error.",

The developed mobile application is voice assistive, which makes the proposed application more user-friendly. Numerous machine learning methods have been examined in this study to predict and diagnose cardiovascular disease (CVD). A detailed comparative study was also drawn using eighteen (18) classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGB, LGBM, Extra Trees Perceptron, and Voting Classifier (hard or soft voting). Sixty-eight thousand nine hundred seventy-five (68,975) samples from various patients were used to test the performance of each approach.

                    "Chronic liver damage is believed to be mostly caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). About 90% of hepatitis C infections progress to chronic hepatitis. Acute HCV infection is a condition that frequently progresses to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer; therefore, understanding this stage of the virus is essential. Molecular and serological testing approaches are often expensive and difficult to perform for diagnosing HCV infection. Machine learning technology can be effectively employed to identify patterns or associations for diagnosing HCV infection. The study utilized machine learning techniques to develop classification models for hepatitis C illness, aiming to anticipate the virus responsible for the infection. Our research integrates various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Cat Boost, Bagging Classifier, SGD Classifier, Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB, Multinomial NB, Linear Discriminant Analysis, ANN, and MLP. Prior to training the models, preprocessing methods, including normalization, filtering, and SMOTE, were used to improve the datasetÃ¢ÂÂs attributes. The classification accuracy scores show encouraging results, with ANN scoring 79.63%, MLP scoring 46.29%, Bernoulli NB scoring 79.62%, Cat Boost scoring 98.14%, and Random Forest scoring 99.53%. Among classification methods, random forest demonstrates the highest accuracy in diagnosing HCV infection.",

                    "The deadliest gynecological cancer affecting women is ovarian cancer, currently incurable with no effective medication treatments. The key focus of this research is to assess insights for early diagnosis using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques on data from clinical trials obtained from 349 patients. Several techniques, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, AdaBoost, and Logistic regression, were applied to find the most reliable factor for ovarian cancer prediction. A clinically evaluated raw dataset of benign samples and malignant ovarian tumor patient data set is used to develop early-stage ovarian cancer predictions, and the effectiveness of ML models was examined utilizing metrics including F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The proposed study shows better outcomes, with the Random Forest classifier exhibiting the highest accuracy for validation at 99% based on the test data of ovarian cancer predictions. Even though early-stage ovarian cancer detection is generally unavailable, cancer diagnosis may be greatly aided by machine learning.",

                    "Cancer patients can benefit from early detection and diagnosis. This study proposes a machine vision strategy for detecting breast cancer in ultrasound images and correcting several ultrasound difficulties such artifacts, speckle noise, and blurring. In quantitative evolution, edge preservation criteria were discovered to be superior to standard ones for hybrid anisotropic diffusion. A learnable super-resolution (SR) is inserted in the deep CNN to dig for extra possible information. The feature is fused with a pre-trained deep CNN model utilizing Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Machine learning (ML) techniques that are used to create these recommendation systems require well-balanced data in terms of class distribution, however most datasets in the real world are imbalanced. Imbalanced data forces a classifier to concentrate on the majority class while ignoring other classes of interest, lowering the predicted performance of any classification model. We propose a generative adversarial networks (GAN) strategy to overcome the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems in this research. Standard data is used to train this model, which assures a high level of resolution. In the testing phase, generalized data of varied resolution is used to evaluate the model's performance. It is discovered through cross-validation that a 5-fold method can successfully eliminate the overfitting problem. With an accuracy of 99.48 %, this suggested feature fusion technique indicates satisfactory performance when compared to current related works. Finally finding cancer region, researcher used U-Net architecture and extract cancer region from BC ultrasound images.",

                    "Thyroid issues are becoming more and more common, and early detection is critical for therapy that reduces mortality and complications. Because of these factors, detecting thyroid problems has become more crucial in the medical field. Estimating the course of a disease accurately and understanding how clinical features interact are critical for medical diagnosis and treatment. All of these limits are overcome in our study by using a standard machine-learning model with proper clinical feature analysis and an ensemble-learning technique. Predicting sickness progression and the interdependence of clinical features or aspects are critical in medical diagnosis and therapy. However, machine learning has enabled us to detect the risk factors for this sickness. To select the best thyroid prediction outcome, we used five machine learning models in addition to the Ensemble ML classifier (hard voting). Class balancing approaches greatly increase classification performance. It has been demonstrated that using random oversampling improves classification results dramatically. Based on the experimental data, our suggested model outperforms existing methods by a wide margin. Using the XGBoost and SelectKBest feature selection strategies, the Ensemble ML classifier achieves the best results on hard voting on RF and DT, with 100â¯% sensitivity and 99.71â¯% accuracy. When features are decreased and the issue of high-class imbalance is addressed, the ensemble ML classifier (hard voting) performs better in dealing with classification challenges.",

                    "Cervical cancer has recently emerged as the leading cause of premature death among women. Around 85% of cervical cancer cases occur in underdeveloped countries. There are several risk factors associated with cervical cancer. This study describes a novel predictive model that uses early screening and risk trends from individual health records to forecast cervical cancer patients' prognoses. This study uses machine learning classification techniques to investigate the risk factors for cervical cancer. Additionally, use the voting method to evaluate all models and select the most appropriate model. The dataset used in this study contains missing values and shows a significant imbalance. Thus, the Random Oversampling technique was used as a sampling method. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and XGBoost feature selection techniques to determine the most important features. To predict the accuracy, we used several machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AdB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). To demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested model, a comparison of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was performed. We used the Random Oversampling approach along with the Ensemble ML method, hard voting on RF and MLP, and achieved 99.19% accuracy.

In order to address the food shortage, a proper plan and technological breakthroughs is must. Tomato is a kind of vegetable which has the healthy ingredients and essential for our daily food list. The proposed system suggests an IoT based tomato cultivation and pest management system, with the help of deep learning methods. In the IoT implementation, camera module and moisture sensor are used to collect images of tomato plant, soil condition respectively. Based on the moisture content, the water pump will supply the water when it necessary. Besides, the real-time images of tomato leaf will be sent to the server to identify and classify natural enemies like various insect species. In the proposed system seven types of pests are identified with the help of ten deep learning models like InceptionV3, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Large, MobileNetV3Small, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201. This study has trained with leaves and insects separately to identify whether an image from a tomato plant is insectoid or not. 458 images of pests and 912 images of leaves are utilized in the proposed architecture. The accuracy of classifying insects or leaves using DenseNet201 is 100 â%. The highest accuracy of 94 â% is obtained to classify the different insects using the DenseNet201 model.",

                    "Air is one of the most significant elements of the environment. The increasing global air pollution crisis poses an unavoidable threat to human health, environmental sustainability, ecosystems, and the earth's climate. Air pollution has been referred to as a silent killer due to its insidious nature. Its indirect impact on human health further underscores its dangerous effects. Early detection of air quality can potentially save millions of lives globally. A unique and transformative approach can harness the power of machine learning to combat air pollution. This research presents a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that provides real-time alerts on air quality status and can help prevent premature deaths, chronic diseases, and other health problems. Air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM 2.5), are used in this study for feature analysis and extraction. The system utilizes publicly available data from 23,463 different cities worldwide. Data preprocessing was performed before feeding the data into the machine learning models for feature correlation and evaluation. The proposed research uses various machine learning models to predict air quality, including Random Forest (100%), Logistic Regression (79%), Decision Tree (100%), Support Vector Machine (93%), Linear SVC (98%), K-Nearest Neighbor (99%), and Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes (52%). A user-friendly Django-based web interface offers an accessible platform for users to monitor air quality in real-time, based on the two best-performing models: Random Forest and Decision Tree techniques.",

                  paperAbstract:
                    "Through the advancement of the contemporary web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, for example, life has become much easier when dealing with certain highly personal problems. The far-reaching consequences of online harassment require immediate preventative steps to safeguard psychological wellness and scholarly achievement via detection at an earlier stage. This piece of writing aims to eliminate online harassment and create a criticism-free online environment. In the paper, we have used a variety of attributes to evaluate a large number of Bengali comments. We communicate cleansed data utilizing machine learning (ML) methods and natural language processing techniques, which must be followed using term frequency and reverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a count vectorizer. In addition, we used tokenization with padding to feed our deep learning (DL) models. Using mathematical visualization and natural language processing, online bullying could be detected quickly. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression Classifier (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Bagging Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Voting Classifier, and Stacking are employed in the research we conducted. We expanded our investigation to include different DL frameworks. Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (C-LSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are all implemented. A large amount of data is required to precisely recognize harassing behavior. To rapidly recognize internet harassment written material, we combined two sets of data, producing 94,000 Bengali comments from different points of view. After understanding the ML and DL models, we can see that a hybrid model (MLP+SGD+LR) performed more effectively when compared to other models, its evaluation accuracy is 99.34%, precision is 99.34%, recall rate is 99.33%, and F1 score is 99.34% on multi-label class. For the binary classification model, we got 99.41% of accuracy.",

                    "Cardiovascular disease is currently a prominent sickness that kills the majority of sufferers. The medical evaluation of cardiac disease presents significant problems. This diagnostic method is complex, requiring precision and efficiency. Early detection of heart disease can significantly lower the chance of death. In light of the high occurrence of cardiac issues in contemporary times, the prediction of heart disease has emerged as one of the most challenging endeavors within the medical field in recent years. Scientists examined a plethora of closely related characteristics to identify the most trustworthy predictors of these diseases. In this work, we use Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect the existence of cardiac problems. The suggested method predicts the likelihood of heart disease and classifies people into risk categories. This is performed by utilizing several machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR). The developed system is trained and evaluated using a composite dataset derived from two separate sources. The results of the experiments show that, when compared to other machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest approach achieves the greatest accuracy rate, achieving an amazing 99.99%.",

                    "Lung cancer is the overgrowth of cells in digestive organs. Identifying different types of lung cancer (squamous cell cancer, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) from lung histopathological images is outrageous works that shorten the chance of infected with lung cancer in the future. This research propounds an accurate diagnosis scheme using various neural network features and fusion of contourlet transform from lung histopathological image. This lesson has used several pre-train models (Alexnet, ResNet50, and VGG-16) in addition to divers scratch models while the pre-train Resnet50 model works better. The two reduction techniques (Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR)) have used to classify the type of lung cancer with the extraction of the most significant properties. In Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based lung cancer detection, the reduction approach PCA performs better. This proposed methodology is performed on ordinary datasets and establishes comparative better performance. The accuracy of this paper is 98.5%, sensitivity 96.50, specificity 97.00%, which is more effective than other approaches. ",

                    "Software-defined network (SDN) is a new network architecture that is more manageable, adaptable, dynamic and programmable. Though the control plane is separated from the forwarding plane and it is directly programmable these make the network to become fast and easy to manage. SDN technology increases network capability and shortens the network configuration and resource management for its programmable features. For forwarding functions and centralized control, SDN supports Open-Flow technology. There are two forms of routing protocols used in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) such as Proactive routing protocol and Reactive routing protocol. The Reactive routing protocol shows the best performance than others when two communicating devices are linked with each other. In this work, Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is implemented as a reactive routing protocol in SDN and analyzes the performance based on using the most essential quality of service (QoS) metrics. Moreover, it is found that for VANET in SDN architecture, the highest packet delay is inferior to other traditional network architectures and the packet transfer rate is also high.",

Besides, in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, itÃ¢ÂÂs onerous to move from one place\nto another, and if a person wants to send a product, he/she needs to go to the courier office. Moreover, many people\nneed to move from their house for attending office, meetings, and traveling from one district to another district for\nspecial purposes. In this paperwork, a system is introduced to reduce the cost and time to send a product from one place\nto another place. Basically, an application is developed to meet the people who want to send a product and another one\nwho want to carry the product. For carrying the product one can easily earn money. After scrutinizing the cost of\ncourier services in Bangladesh, an algorithm is introduced to calculate the carrying cost of the product and an algorithm\nis also developed for product security.",

                    "Diabetes is considered one of the incurable diseases at present which is caused by hyperglycemia. Modern\nhealthcare finds some attributes such as uncontrolled lifestyle, lack of balanced diets, genetic complexities,\nexcess mental fatigue, obesities, and so on, which are responsible to precipitate the rapid mobility of diabetes\ndiseases. This is not only a single disease but it also damages the nervous systems, heart, kidney, liver, eyes,\nand various organic metabolisms. Currently, the clinical industries have a huge amount of data for the\ndiagnosis of diabetic patients. Machine learning algorithms can work appropriately to mitigate this tedious\ntask in finding hidden patterns, discovering knowledge from the database, and predict outcomes. This\nresearch has proposed an efficient machine learning-based diagnosis methodology that outperforms the\nexisting similar methodologies. The experiment selects the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance\n(mRMR) features from the working dataset and then recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique for\noptimization. The irregularity problem in the dataset is addressed by the synthetic minority oversampling\ntechnique (SMOTE). Machine learning classification is performed on the selected optimized features through\nDecision Tree (C4.5 DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NBs), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\nLogistic Regression (LGR), and Random Forest (RF), where RF classifier produces best-suited results with\nminimum false detection rate.

                    "We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry 4.0. Generally, 4IR considered as the mixture of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other frontier technologies. It is obvious that nowadays a plethora of smart devices is providing services to make the daily life of humans easier. However, in the morning most people around the globe use a traditional mirror while preparing themselves for daily tasks. The aim is to build a low-cost intelligent mirror system that can display a variety of details based on user recommendations. Therefore, in this article, Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-based smart mirror is introduced that will support the users to receive the necessary daily update of weather information, date, time, calendar, to-do list, updated news headlines, traffic updates, COVID-19 cases status and so on. Moreover, a face detection method also implemented with the smart mirror to construct the architecture more secure. Our proposed MirrorME application provides a success rate of nearly 87% in interacting with the features of face recognition and voice input. The mirror is capable of delivering multimedia facilities while maintaining high levels of security within the device.",

In the academic field, attendance is recorded and updated manually in the teacherÃ¢ÂÂs notebook or any other application. In general, these types of systems waste time for both students and teachers. Also, other Job sectors use fingerprint attendance for arrival and departure, but the time between arrival and departure the employee can go outside anytime that he wants. So, this problem we can overcome using the unique feature of every human being on his face. In this proposed system, facial recognition technology is used to automatically take attendance. Sometimes when many people can come together. This system can able to detect multiple faces at a time. In this system, Face detection is done using DLib and ResNet-34 is used for face recognition. Using two cameras arrival and departure times of an individual are calculated sequentially. 96.03% accuracy observed by the camera-1 to recognize the face and at day time when light is off camera-2 shows the best accuracy 96.62%.",

This paper presented a home automation security system that employs the Internet of Things (IoT) for remote\naccess to one's home through an Android application, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to ensure the home's\nsecurity. Face recognition is utilized to control door entry in a highly efficient security system. In the event of a\ntechnical failure, an additional security PIN is set up that is only accessible by the owner. Although a home automation\nsystem may be used for various tasks, the cost is prohibitive for many customers. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\nprovide a budget and user-friendly system, ensuring access to the application and home attributes by using multi-modal\nsecurity.

                    "Disease diagnosis is the most critical task in the medical diagnosis system. At present, the biggest challenge\nis to predict heart disease very quickly; for that limitation, the number of dying people is increasing day by\nday. If a heart disease is diagnosed quickly, we can reduce the death rate indisputably. Thus, this research\nproduces a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that can confer a conceptual report of clear\nwarning of patient's heart condition. The proposed prediction system predicts heart disease using some health\nparameters. The system uses thirteen health parameters like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, ECG,\netc. Eight algorithms are used separately to diagnose heart disease accurately, namely KNN, XgBoost,\nLogistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ada Boost, Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, and\nRandom Forest (RF). Decision Tree and Random Forest provide better performance than others among all\nmethods. This research also established a website to easily check their heart condition from home instantly.\nThe system has used 1026 individual patients' data for training and testing. It achieves higher accuracy in the\ndifferent algorithms such as DT (99%), RF (99%), XgBoost (95%), KNN (89%), SVM (85%), LR (85%),\nAda Boost (83%) and NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (82%). The experiment result provides a target value of 0 or 1 that refers\nto the patient's presence or absence of heart disease. ",

                    "The rapid spreading of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused severe respiratory infections affecting the lungs. Automatic diagnosis helps to fight against COVID-19 in community outbreaks. Medical imaging technology can reinforce disease monitoring and detection facilities with the advancement of computer vision. Unfortunately, deep learning models are facing starvation of more generalized datasets as the data repositories of COVID-19 are not rich enough to provide significant distinct features. To address the limitation, this article describes the generation of synthetic images of COVID-19 along with other chest infections with distinct features by empirical top entropy-based patch selection approach using the generative adversarial network. After that, a diagnosis is performed through a faster region-based convolutional neural network using 6,406 synthetic as well as 3,933 original chest X-ray images of different chest infections, which also addressed the data imbalance problems and not recumbent to a particular class. The experiment confirms a satisfactory COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy of 99.16% in a multi-class scenario.",

                    "Dengue fever is a severe disease spread by Aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs) in tropical areas such as Bangladesh. Since its breakout in the 1960s, dengue fever has been endemic in Bangladesh, with the highest concentration of infections in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to develop a machine learning model that can use relevant information about the factors that cause Dengue outbreaks within a geographic region. To predict dengue cases in 11 different districts of Bangladesh, we created a DengueBD dataset and employed two machine learning algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This research also explores the correlation among environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, and humidity with the rise and decline trend of Dengue cases in different cities of Bangladesh. The entire dataset was divided into an 80:20 ratio, with 80 percent used for training and 20% used for testing. The research findings imply that, for both the MLR with 67% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.57 and SVR models with 75% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.95, the number of dengue cases reduces throughout the winter season in the country and increases mainly during the rainy season in the next ten months, from August 2021 to May 2022. Importantly, Dhaka, BangladeshÃ¢ÂÂs capital, will see the maximum number of dengue patients during this period. ",

                    "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world. It is a dangerous health disorder caused by the interruption of the blood flow to the brain, resulting in severe illness, disability, or death. An accurate prediction of stroke is necessary for the early stage of treatment and overcoming the mortality rate. This study proposes a machine learning approach to diagnose stroke with imbalanced data more accurately. Random Over Sampling (ROS) technique has been used in this work to balance the data. Eleven classifiers, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes, Voting Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perception, and Nearest Centroid, are analyzed in this study. Ten classifiers show more than 90% accurate results before balancing the data and four classifiers display more than 96% accurate results after data-balancing using the oversampling method. The Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed in each model to enhance the results. Moreover, Accuracy, F1-Measure, Precision, and Recall are used to measure the performance of machine learning models. The results show the Support Vector Machine has the highest accuracy of 99.99%, with recall values of 99.99%, precision values of 99.99%, and F1-measure of 99.99%. Random Forest achieves the second-highest accuracy of 99.87%, with a 0.001% error. ",

                    "Early detection and characterization are considered crucial in treating and controlling the chronic renal disease. Because of the rising number of patients, the high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the poor prognosis of morbidity and mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Detecting CKD in its early stages is critical for saving millions of lives. The uniqueness of this study lies in developing a diagnosis system to detect chronic kidney disease using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with the support of a hybrid feature selection approach. This study exploited the 400 clinical data of CKD patients based on the dataset supplied by the University of California Irvine (UCI) available at their Machine Learning repository. Different data preparation techniques like encoding categorical features, missing values imputation, removing outlier factors, handling data imbalance, scaling data at the same level, and selecting relevant features are adopted to prepare the dataset for the prediction model. A hybrid Chi-squared test (Chi2) and Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection approach is proposed to remove redundant features, and a Pearson correlation matrix is also computed to consider the top important features for the prediction. Lastly, the Extra tress classifier can diagnose CKD with 98% accuracy and a 2% true negative rate without data leakage out of 14 machine learning models.",

                    "COVID-19 is one of the most life-threatening and dangerous diseases caused by the novel Coronavirus, which has already afflicted a larger human community worldwide. This pandemic disease recovery is possible if detected in the early stage. We proposed an automated deep learning approach from Computed Tomography (CT) scan images to detect COVID-19 positive patients by following a four-phase paradigm for COVID-19 detection: preprocess the CT scan images; remove noise from test image by using anisotropic diffusion techniques; make a different segment for the preprocessed images; and train and test COVID-19 detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. This study employed well-known pre-trained models, including AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16 and VGG19 to evaluate experiments. 80% of images are used to train the network in the detection process, while the remaining 20% are used to test it. The result of the experiment evaluation confirmed that the VGG19 pre-trained CNN model achieved better accuracy (98.06%).",

                    "In recent times, various forms of crime have been happening worldwide. The law-and-order department of any country officially records a crime in electronic forms or on paper when the crime is reported by a victim or someone on behalf of the victim. The document that is prepared to file any perceptible committed crimes including dowry, kidnap, murder, rape, theft, and others is called First Information Report(FIR). Nowadays, online FIR also known as e-FIR has been used worldwide. Every day a number of e-FIR are filed, and they are maintained in a centralized database with the aid of third-party trust. Consequently, malicious entities including insiders and outsidersÃ¢ÂÂ dishonest personnel, and third-party authorities may tamper with e-FIR that questions the transparency and integrity of FIR reports. To address this exposure, in this paper, we propose a blockchain based FIR system to store all kinds of offense-related records to assure security, fidelity and privacy of FIR records. In this proposed system, the blockchain technology that refers to a decentralized and distributed ledger across peer-to-peer networks continually updates the shared ledger and strictly maintains synchronization among all network nodes. Though blockchain technology guarantees tamper-proof of the data, it cannot store a large amount of data due to the replication of ledger among all network nodes. ",

                    "A central nervous system known as an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has long-term effects on a person's capacity for engagement and interaction with others. Since its symptoms often manifest in the first two years of life, autism is considered to be a behavioral condition that can be identified at any point in a person's life. This study investigated the potentiality of machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to predict ASD using some health parameters. There are 292 instances and 21 attributes in the first dataset linked to the screening for ASD in children. The adult individuals in the second dataset had a total of 704 occurrences and 21 characteristics related to ASD detection. In order to achieve the highest accuracy possible from the machine learning models, feature optimization is used in this study along with other preprocessing approaches. The findings overwhelmingly support the notion that Random Forest performs better on all of these datasets, with the greatest accuracy (100%) for data on Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children and adults, respectively.",

                    "Breast cancer disease is recognized as one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide after lung cancer. Breast cancer refers to a malignant neoplasm that develops from breast cells. Developed and less developed countries both are suffering from this extensive cancer. This cancer can be recuperated if it is detected at an early stage. Many researchers have proposed several machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer with the highest accuracy in the past years. In this research work, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) has been used as a training set from the UCI machine learning repository to compare the performance of the various machine learning techniques. Different kinds of machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors(K-NN), Decision tree (DT), NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Nearest Cluster Classifier (NCC), and voting classifier (VC) have been used for comparing and analyzing breast cancer into benign and malignant tumors. Various matrices such as error rate, Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, and recall have been implemented to measure the model's performance. Each Algorithm's accuracy has been ascertained for finding the best suitable one. Based on the analysis, the result shows that the Voting classifier has the highest accuracy, which is 98.77%, with the lowest error rate. Finally, a web page is developed using a flask micro-framework integrating the best model using react.",

Explainable machine learning (XML) is a new approach that aims to provide transparency and interpretability for machine learning models. The entire experiment has been performed in the lung cancer dataset obtained from Kaggle. The outcome of the predictive model with ROS (Random Oversampling) class balancing technique is used to comprehend the most relevant clinical features that contributed to the prediction of lung cancer using a machine learning explainable technique termed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation). The results show the robustness of GBM's capacity to detect lung cancer, with 98.76% accuracy, 98.79% precision, 98.76% recall, 98.76% F-Measure, and 0.16% error rate, respectively.

                    "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia among older people. In addition, a considerable portion of the world's population suffers from metabolic problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. Alzheimer's disease affects the brain in a degenerative manner. As the elderly population grows, this illness can cause more people to become inactive by impairing their memory and physical functionality. This might impact their family members and the financial, economic, and social spheres. Researchers have recently investigated different machine learning and deep learning approaches to detect such diseases at an earlier stage. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD help patients to recover from it successfully and with the least harm. This paper proposes a machine learning model that comprises GaussianNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, and GradientBoost to predict Alzheimer's disease. The model is trained using the open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) dataset to evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings showed that the voting classifier attained the highest validation accuracy of 96% for the AD dataset. Therefore, ML algorithms have the potential to drastically lower Alzheimer's disease annual mortality rates through accurate detection.",

                    "Nowadays, one of the most important illnesses is a heart disease which causes most patients dead. The medical diagnosis of heart disease is quite difficult. This diagnosis is a challenging process that requires accuracy and efficiency. The chance of death will be decreased with early heart disease detection. Because cardiac problems are now a fairly frequent ailment, predicting heart disease has become one of the most difficult medical jobs in recent years. Researchers looked at a variety of closely related traits to discover the most reliable predictors of these conditions. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to identify the presence of cardiac abnormalities. The proposed method predicts the chances of heart disease and classifies patient's risk level by using different ML algorithm techniques such as Decision Tree (DT), Ada-Boost Classifier (AB), Extra trees Classifier (ET), Support vector Machine (SVM), Gradient boost, MLP, extreme gradient boost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), KNN, and LR. Three different datasets are combined to train and test the proposed system. The experimental results show that, when compared to other ML algorithms, the Decision Tree algorithm has the highest accuracy, at 99.16%.",

As a result, it may raise a variety of serious security issues. This study suggests a remote access home automation security system that incorporates utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for ensuring the security of the house. For a highly efficient security system, Face recognition has been used to maneuver the door access. In case of power outage or for any technical issues, an alternative security PIN has been added which is only accessible by the owner. Moreover, individuals are able to monitor and control the door access along with other attributes of the house using an application. In this work, Face detection is performed using the Haar Cascade classifier, while face recognition is performed using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH). 95.7% accuracy in recognizing faces has been achieved after evaluating the proposed system.",

                    "In this age of technology, the popularity, and necessity of mobile applications in the field of education are increasing day by day. Many students in Bangladesh are not able to develop as qualified due to a lack of a suitable environment and skilled teachers. This problem has been solved to a large extent through various E-Learning applications. But no research has yet been done on exactly how efficient, intuitive, and usable these applications are. Therefore, this study's objectives are to assess these E-Learning appsÃ¢ÂÂ usability in the context of Bangladesh and to offer potential architectural recommendations for improving their usability and acceptance. To accomplish the objectives, the usability of five E-Learning applications (Bacbon, Prottoy, Shikho, Classroom, and Muktopaath) developed in the context of Bangladesh was evaluated through Heuristic Evaluation and Semiotic Evaluation process. The study showed that all selected applications have several usability problems. The heuristic evaluation is based on the principle of efficiency, consistency, flexibility, conventions, and error management of each application while the semiotic evaluation upheld the intuitiveness of the interface elements of the selected applications. Finally, to enhance the usability of these applications, some sets of recommendations and implications have been presented for practitioners.\n\n",

                    "Different kinds of educational systems have been applied in learning and teaching to maximize the slope of the learning curve of the students. One of those educational systems is the OBE system or Outcome-based education. Outcome-based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world, at multiple levels. In this education system, students and teachers have a clear view of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course. However, in this education system, as many of the students are trying to get the same outcome, weak students are getting behind to achieve their goals. Hence creating inequity, the proposed work uses the prior student data to apply the Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes (CO-PO) attainment model and recommends the students to focus on their individual weaknesses. So as the students are studying through their courses, their results are recorded. Then the data of those students are used to train the application in our proposed work. Consequently, the application can identify pupils who need to learn their needed topics. As a result of this proposed method, students with different abilities can not only rely on the outcome, but also have to develop their required subjects to thrive in their learning process.",

Suitable relief, steep terrain gradients, Permiancyclothems and Pennsylvanian that weather into fine-grained soils which have extensive clay, and appropriate precipitation are present in Chittagong, Bandarban, and other hillside regions of Bangladesh. In order to map landslide susceptibility for some of the areas in Rangamati District, Bangladesh, this study compares and evaluates a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Byes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and the hybrid approaches. This studyâs combination of logistic regression and random forest demonstrated 91.1% accuracy in landslide prediction.

                    "Crop disease is considered as a major constraint to both food quality and production. Even in this era of precision agriculture, the lacking of compulsory infrastructure has made rapid identification of crop diseases quite hard in numerous regions around the world. In this paper, we introduced a new method based on biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) to identify prime maize leaf diseases. We performed biorthogonal wavelet decomposition and pixel wise morphological operation to segment the maize leaf lesion from input image. For feature extraction, by applying 2-D biorthogonal wavelet transform (BWT) at multiple levels we proposed a novel method to extract colour channel wise wavelet entropy features by investigating discriminatory potential of three different biorthogonal wavelet filters (bior3.3, bior3.5, and bior3.7). The effectiveness of our extracted features were evaluated by employing five different classifiers and obtaining 95.78% overall identification accuracy with 10-fold cross validation.",

                    "An automated fruit identification system may be used in the supermarket to help consumers determine the type and standard of fruits. Automatic fruit categorization and recognition is becoming increasingly popular, but it is also becoming more difficult due to low contrast and ambiguous characteristics. Proposed research used deep learning algorithms to classify fruit images and developed a web-based system for autonomous fruit identification. However, autonomous fruit categorization is not a relatively easy process that is dependent on the locations, shapes, colors, and sizes of the objects. Proposed study collected samples from different local places, then removed images backdrops and improved them for a more accurate result. ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and MobileNet were utilized to achieve more precise feature extraction. Among these, MobileNet achieved 99.21% accuracy in feature extraction, outperforming previously proposed machine learning techniques. 3240 samples of eight different fruits are collected from the Bangladeshi countryside, including Carambola, Bilimbi, Elephant Apple, Emblica, Burmese Grape, Sapodilla, Tamarind, and Wood Apple. As a consequence of this research, the proposed approach will aid individuals and industry in recognizing local fruits due to its high accuracy rate and web-based system.",

                    'Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common problem among people with diabetes that can result in amputation of the affected limb. Modern DFU treatment and diagnosis methods are expensive and time-consuming. Today, the development of the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method makes it possible for pathologists to diagnose DFU more swiftly and accurately. This has led to a rise in interest in deep learning (DL) approaches based on CAD. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called "DFU_MultiNet," which focuses on the transfer learning approach to classify healthy and ulcer skin images using publicly available repositories. The proposed framework is developed to offer an efficient and robust method for DFU classification that determines the distinction between healthy and ulcerated skin. The proposed approach extracts features from foot samples using three well-known pre-trained CNN models: VGG19, DenseNet201, and NasNetMobile. Finally, these extracted results are merged through a summing layer to create a powerful hybrid network. Through obtaining impressive accuracy (99.06 %), precision (100.00 %), recall (98.18 %), specificity (100.00 %), F1-score (99.08 %), and AUC (99.09 %) the proposed "DFU_MultiNet" framework holds great potential as a diagnostic tool in healthcare and clinical settings.',

As CKC does not show any earlier symptoms, the earlier prediction will be very effective to elevate its effect. In this paper, a machine learning-based method for diagnosing CKC at an early stage is proposed. SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Native Bayes, Logistic Regression, LGBM, CatBoost, and AdaBoost are employed for classification purposes, and among these algorithms, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and LGBM give 99% accuracy. Data pre-processing and feature selection help improve the accuracy of the proposed model. The outcome of the comparative analysis of our proposed work with eight existing approaches proves the robustness and supremacy of the work. Furthermore, the best model is also used to develop a user-friendly web application.",

                    "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes. Traditional techniques of DFU analysis and therapy are more time-consuming and costly. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep neural networks, has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in medical applications. Despite this, the lack of explainability of deep learning models is currently viewed as a key hurdle to using these approaches in actual clinical settings. In this research, we present the DFU_XAI framework for assessing the interpretability of explainable-driven deep learning (DL) models. DFU_XAI evaluates five DL models (Xception, DenseNet121, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2) to establish a transparent DL framework using three state-of-the-art explanation methods: Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet50 outperformed the other four models with remarkable results: 98.75% accuracy, 99.2% precision, 97.6% recall, 98.4% F1-score, and 98.5% AUC. For the most part, it can locate diabetic foot ulcers precisely on a diabetic foot and discriminate between diabetic foot ulcers and healthy feet in the DFU dataset. A heat map will indicate the precise location of the ulcer that needs care. ",

                    "The third most common disease in the world that leads to mortality is colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonoscopy, which locates and removes colonic polyps, is the most common procedure worldwide for the early identification and preventative treatment of colorectal cancer. The likelihood of a CRC patient dying can be considerably decreased by early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous polyps. Unidentified polyps may eventually turn into cancer. Although several classification algorithms have been put out to identify polyps, their effectiveness has not yet been compared to that of skilled endoscopes. An ensemble machine learning-based classification approach for detecting colorectal cancer from colonoscopy images is presented in this research. Firstly researchers collect colorectal cancer or polyp images from three standard datasets. In the preprocessing phase, researcher convert the RGB image to grayscale image and identified the region of interest (ROI) by removing the unwanted regions. A hybrid anisotropic diffusion filtering (HADF) approach was employed to eliminate noise from each image. Then the system extracts features from individual feature extractor methods and fused extracted features in a vector. The fused features help to detect colorectal polyp or cancer for increasing cancer or polyp identification rates. Finally, an ensemble classifier classifies the colorectal cancer or normal images and achieves better accuracy. The suggested technique exceeds the prior conventional methods, according to tests on widely used public datasets, improving accuracy by 99.45 %, sensitivity by 99.30 %, specificityby 99.58 %, and precision 99.53 %.",

In this research, a novel approach is presented that leverages deep hybrid learning techniques to enhance the biometric authentication system, combining various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors with deep learning architectures including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, and Inception. After authentication it extends to the design of a blockchain-based voting scheme, powered by smart contracts and NEAR wallet integration. This innovative model constructs a robust and secure blockchain-based e-voting solution. This research represents a significant step towards achieving a balance between the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic voting schemes while upholding the integrity and privacy crucial to the democratic process.",

                    "Perinatal asphyxia is one of the top three causes of neonatal death in developing countries, killing over 1.2 million newborns yearly. Asphyxia cannot be definitively diagnosed early on visually or physically; instead, it can only be diagnosed medically. In this research, an ensemble machine learning-based approach is proposed to detect infant asphyxia at the early stage. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which divide each featureâs values into the time domain and the frequency domain, were originally used in the technique to evaluate feature extraction methodologies. Unwanted noise, outliers, missing numbers, label encoding, and other difficulties are eliminated using pre-processing techniques. By applying the random oversampling (ROS) method, data balance is achieved. After analyzing and evaluating the performance of the proposed model, it is observed that the highest accuracy 99.29% is obtained using the combination of logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor with a 0.007% rate of error.",

In healthcare, especially cardiology, it is crucial to accurately and quickly diagnose cardiac problems. In this research, we proposed an accurate and efficient mobile application-based system for diagnosing cardiac disease based on machine learning approaches. The developed mobile application is voice assistive, which makes the proposed application more user-friendly. Numerous machine learning methods have been examined in this study to predict and diagnose cardiovascular disease (CVD). A detailed comparative study was also drawn using eighteen (18) classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGB, LGBM, Extra Trees Perceptron, and Voting Classifier (hard or soft voting). Sixty-eight thousand nine hundred seventy-five (68,975) samples from various patients were used to test the performance of each approach. According to the study, Random Forest and Decision Trees have the best accuracy levels at 99.9%. However, the Support Vector Machine classifier had the lowest performance, barely achieving 60% accuracy.",

                    "Chronic liver damage is believed to be mostly caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). About 90% of hepatitis C infections progress to chronic hepatitis. Acute HCV infection is a condition that frequently progresses to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer; therefore, understanding this stage of the virus is essential. Molecular and serological testing approaches are often expensive and difficult to perform for diagnosing HCV infection. Machine learning technology can be effectively employed to identify patterns or associations for diagnosing HCV infection. The study utilized machine learning techniques to develop classification models for hepatitis C illness, aiming to anticipate the virus responsible for the infection. Our research integrates various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Cat Boost, Bagging Classifier, SGD Classifier, Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB, Multinomial NB, Linear Discriminant Analysis, ANN, and MLP. Prior to training the models, preprocessing methods, including normalization, filtering, and SMOTE, were used to improve the datasetÃ¢ÂÂs attributes. The classification accuracy scores show encouraging results, with ANN scoring 79.63%, MLP scoring 46.29%, Bernoulli NB scoring 79.62%, Cat Boost scoring 98.14%, and Random Forest scoring 99.53%. Among classification methods, random forest demonstrates the highest accuracy in diagnosing HCV infection.",

Several techniques, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, AdaBoost, and Logistic regression, were applied to find the most reliable factor for ovarian cancer prediction. A clinically evaluated raw dataset of benign samples and malignant ovarian tumor patient data set is used to develop early-stage ovarian cancer predictions, and the effectiveness of ML models was examined utilizing metrics including F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The proposed study shows better outcomes, with the Random Forest classifier exhibiting the highest accuracy for validation at 99% based on the test data of ovarian cancer predictions.

                    "Cancer patients can benefit from early detection and diagnosis. This study proposes a machine vision strategy for detecting breast cancer in ultrasound images and correcting several ultrasound difficulties such artifacts, speckle noise, and blurring. In quantitative evolution, edge preservation criteria were discovered to be superior to standard ones for hybrid anisotropic diffusion. A learnable super-resolution (SR) is inserted in the deep CNN to dig for extra possible information. The feature is fused with a pre-trained deep CNN model utilizing Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Machine learning (ML) techniques that are used to create these recommendation systems require well-balanced data in terms of class distribution, however most datasets in the real world are imbalanced. Imbalanced data forces a classifier to concentrate on the majority class while ignoring other classes of interest, lowering the predicted performance of any classification model. We propose a generative adversarial networks (GAN) strategy to overcome the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems in this research. Standard data is used to train this model, which assures a high level of resolution. In the testing phase, generalized data of varied resolution is used to evaluate the model's performance. It is discovered through cross-validation that a 5-fold method can successfully eliminate the overfitting problem. With an accuracy of 99.48 %, this suggested feature fusion technique indicates satisfactory performance when compared to current related works. Finally finding cancer region, researcher used U-Net architecture and extract cancer region from BC ultrasound images.",

                    "Thyroid issues are becoming more and more common, and early detection is critical for therapy that reduces mortality and complications. Because of these factors, detecting thyroid problems has become more crucial in the medical field. Estimating the course of a disease accurately and understanding how clinical features interact are critical for medical diagnosis and treatment. All of these limits are overcome in our study by using a standard machine-learning model with proper clinical feature analysis and an ensemble-learning technique. Predicting sickness progression and the interdependence of clinical features or aspects are critical in medical diagnosis and therapy. However, machine learning has enabled us to detect the risk factors for this sickness. To select the best thyroid prediction outcome, we used five machine learning models in addition to the Ensemble ML classifier (hard voting). Class balancing approaches greatly increase classification performance. It has been demonstrated that using random oversampling improves classification results dramatically. Based on the experimental data, our suggested model outperforms existing methods by a wide margin. Using the XGBoost and SelectKBest feature selection strategies, the Ensemble ML classifier achieves the best results on hard voting on RF and DT, with 100â¯% sensitivity and 99.71â¯% accuracy. When features are decreased and the issue of high-class imbalance is addressed, the ensemble ML classifier (hard voting) performs better in dealing with classification challenges.",

This study describes a novel predictive model that uses early screening and risk trends from individual health records to forecast cervical cancer patients' prognoses. This study uses machine learning classification techniques to investigate the risk factors for cervical cancer. Additionally, use the voting method to evaluate all models and select the most appropriate model. The dataset used in this study contains missing values and shows a significant imbalance. Thus, the Random Oversampling technique was used as a sampling method. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and XGBoost feature selection techniques to determine the most important features. To predict the accuracy, we used several machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (AdB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). To demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested model, a comparison of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was performed. We used the Random Oversampling approach along with the Ensemble ML method, hard voting on RF and MLP, and achieved 99.19% accuracy. It is demonstrated that the ensemble ML classifier (hard voting) performs better at handling classification problems when features are decreased and the high-class imbalance problem is handled.",

                    "Since the world's population is rising continuously, more cultivable land is being utilized for their dwellings. As a result, the amount of food supply is decreasing day by day. In order to address the food shortage, a proper plan and technological breakthroughs is must. Tomato is a kind of vegetable which has the healthy ingredients and essential for our daily food list. The proposed system suggests an IoT based tomato cultivation and pest management system, with the help of deep learning methods. In the IoT implementation, camera module and moisture sensor are used to collect images of tomato plant, soil condition respectively. Based on the moisture content, the water pump will supply the water when it necessary. Besides, the real-time images of tomato leaf will be sent to the server to identify and classify natural enemies like various insect species. In the proposed system seven types of pests are identified with the help of ten deep learning models like InceptionV3, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Large, MobileNetV3Small, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201. This study has trained with leaves and insects separately to identify whether an image from a tomato plant is insectoid or not. 458 images of pests and 912 images of leaves are utilized in the proposed architecture. The accuracy of classifying insects or leaves using DenseNet201 is 100 â%. The highest accuracy of 94 â% is obtained to classify the different insects using the DenseNet201 model.",

                    "Air is one of the most significant elements of the environment. The increasing global air pollution crisis poses an unavoidable threat to human health, environmental sustainability, ecosystems, and the earth's climate. Air pollution has been referred to as a silent killer due to its insidious nature. Its indirect impact on human health further underscores its dangerous effects. Early detection of air quality can potentially save millions of lives globally. A unique and transformative approach can harness the power of machine learning to combat air pollution. This research presents a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that provides real-time alerts on air quality status and can help prevent premature deaths, chronic diseases, and other health problems. Air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM 2.5), are used in this study for feature analysis and extraction. The system utilizes publicly available data from 23,463 different cities worldwide. Data preprocessing was performed before feeding the data into the machine learning models for feature correlation and evaluation. The proposed research uses various machine learning models to predict air quality, including Random Forest (100%), Logistic Regression (79%), Decision Tree (100%), Support Vector Machine (93%), Linear SVC (98%), K-Nearest Neighbor (99%), and Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes (52%). A user-friendly Django-based web interface offers an accessible platform for users to monitor air quality in real-time, based on the two best-performing models: Random Forest and Decision Tree techniques.",

                    "Through the advancement of the contemporary web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, for example, life has become much easier when dealing with certain highly personal problems. The far-reaching consequences of online harassment require immediate preventative steps to safeguard psychological wellness and scholarly achievement via detection at an earlier stage. This piece of writing aims to eliminate online harassment and create a criticism-free online environment. In the paper, we have used a variety of attributes to evaluate a large number of Bengali comments. We communicate cleansed data utilizing machine learning (ML) methods and natural language processing techniques, which must be followed using term frequency and reverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a count vectorizer. In addition, we used tokenization with padding to feed our deep learning (DL) models. Using mathematical visualization and natural language processing, online bullying could be detected quickly. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression Classifier (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Bagging Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Voting Classifier, and Stacking are employed in the research we conducted. We expanded our investigation to include different DL frameworks. Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (C-LSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are all implemented. A large amount of data is required to precisely recognize harassing behavior. To rapidly recognize internet harassment written material, we combined two sets of data, producing 94,000 Bengali comments from different points of view. After understanding the ML and DL models, we can see that a hybrid model (MLP+SGD+LR) performed more effectively when compared to other models, its evaluation accuracy is 99.34%, precision is 99.34%, recall rate is 99.33%, and F1 score is 99.34% on multi-label class. For the binary classification model, we got 99.41% of accuracy.",

This diagnostic method is complex, requiring precision and efficiency. Early detection of heart disease can significantly lower the chance of death. In light of the high occurrence of cardiac issues in contemporary times, the prediction of heart disease has emerged as one of the most challenging endeavors within the medical field in recent years. Scientists examined a plethora of closely related characteristics to identify the most trustworthy predictors of these diseases. In this work, we use Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect the existence of cardiac problems. The suggested method predicts the likelihood of heart disease and classifies people into risk categories. This is performed by utilizing several machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR). The developed system is trained and evaluated using a composite dataset derived from two separate sources. The results of the experiments show that, when compared to other machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest approach achieves the greatest accuracy rate, achieving an amazing 99.99%.",

                    "  Face detection is a popular research topic to the researchers at present in the Biometric system. The aim of this research is to develop a system which can detect human face or faces from a live video streaming and warn by giving the siren for ensuring the significant role in the surveillance security aspects. The core of this control system includes ATMega328p Microcontroller based Arduino Uno with Pan-Tilt mechanism and Open Source Computer Vision System (OpenCV) is the platform for the image processing system. For detecting human face or faces existing methods are Haar-Cascade, Camshift, Hausdorff distance, AdaBoost, viola jones, etc. Amongst all of this we used Haar classifier Cascade algorithm for face detection in this research",

                    "  Face detection is a popular research topic to the researchers at present in the Biometric system. The aim of this research is to develop a system which can detect human face or faces from a live video streaming and warn by giving the siren for ensuring the significant role in the surveillance security aspects. The core of this control system includes ATMega328p Microcontroller based Arduino Uno with Pan-Tilt mechanism and Open Source Computer Vision System (OpenCV) is the platform for the image processing system. For detecting human face or faces existing methods are Haar-Cascade, Camshift, Hausdorff distance, AdaBoost, viola jones, etc. Amongst all of this we used Haar classifier Cascade algorithm for face detection in this research",

                    "  Face detection is a popular research topic to the researchers at present in the Biometric system. The aim of this research is to develop a system which can detect human face or faces from a live video streaming and warn by giving the siren for ensuring the significant role in the surveillance security aspects. The core of this control system includes ATMega328p Microcontroller based Arduino Uno with Pan-Tilt mechanism and Open Source Computer Vision System (OpenCV) is the platform for the image processing system. For detecting human face or faces existing methods are Haar-Cascade, Camshift, Hausdorff distance, AdaBoost, viola jones, etc. Amongst all of this we used Haar classifier Cascade algorithm for face detection in this research",

                    "  Face detection is a popular research topic to the researchers at present in the Biometric system. The aim of this research is to develop a system which can detect human face or faces from a live video streaming and warn by giving the siren for ensuring the significant role in the surveillance security aspects. The core of this control system includes ATMega328p Microcontroller based Arduino Uno with Pan-Tilt mechanism and Open Source Computer Vision System (OpenCV) is the platform for the image processing system. For detecting human face or faces existing methods are Haar-Cascade, Camshift, Hausdorff distance, AdaBoost, viola jones, etc. Amongst all of this we used Haar classifier Cascade algorithm for face detection in this research",

                    "The scope of the establishment of internetworking security is large enough that requires special attention to details to realize its ultimate wholesome state. As soon as the Data/Information is placed in a medium to transmit over to the next hop, it is at risk of being fabricated by the Man-in-the-middle. Over the years many encryption/decryption algorithms were invented to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the content co compiled at the sender end. Cryptography is a subset of cryptography that only deals with encrypting data that can be passed through secure channels along with keys to ensure security. Where cryptology deals with both encryption and decryption processes. Cryptographic algorithms are primarily categorized into two types - Symmetric and Asymmetric. The main objective of this review paper is to identify how some public (asymmetric) and private (symmetric) keys algorithms fare against each category with respect to attack resistance, efficiency, and other relative measures. Two symmetric algorithms namely Hill Cipher and Data Encryption Standards (DES) were compared against two well known asymmetric key algorithms namely RSA and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in this study. The computational and implementation complexities of the algorithms were parts of the discussion as well.\n",

                    "Abstract- Internet banking has become a crucial aspect of modern financial transactions, enabling customers to access their account information and perform various transactions from anywhere. Ensuring the security of these transactions is one of utmost importance, and this is where authentication protocols come into play. One such protocol is Kerberos, which is widely used for secure authentication in many applications, including internet banking. In this paper we discuss the basic operations and functionalities of Kerberos while pinpointing the    advantages of using Kerberos as an authentication protocol in internet banking. We also discuss the security features of using Kerberos, including its use of encrypted tickets and its ability to prevent replay attacks.\n\nIndex Terms- Internet Banking, Cyber Security, Authentication, Kerberos, Multi factor authentication server, Replay attack.\n",

                    "Abstract\nThe use of technology in all parts of our lives has greatly increased in recent years, nowadays, people tend to\nsearch for everything online before they make decisions. However, looking for rental houses online is not\ncommon in Bangladesh, it is not because people do not want to, but because there are not many online\nplatforms focusing on residential rentals. For the mentioned reason we developed a house rental finding web\napplication using Laravel, Vue.js, and PHP-ML library. Laravel handles the backend whereas Vue.js manages\nthe frontend, we utilized PHP Machine Learning LibraryÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to build a machine learning model for the search system. The goal is to make it easier to find\nrental properties. Our system gives personalized suggestions based on user inputs, like location, rental price,\nproperty size, and the number of rooms and bathrooms. Our application aims to make searching for rental\nhouses a better experience and more efficient.\nKeywords: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),\nMachine Learning (ML), JavaScript (JS), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)\n",

                    "Abstract- The term Digital Bangladesh is a misnomer. Like every other nation in the world, Bangladesh has a strong desire to become a digitized nation to realize the vision 2041. This is a review paper. There are some research works that were carried out in this arena but none really pinpointed the exact issues and ways to deal with those problems. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the actual reasons behind information insecurity as well as to provide some recommendations to minimize the insecurity which may help realize the dream of Digital Bangladesh. The main contribution of the work lies in the form of networking insecurity -the prime impediment to Digital Bangladesh. This study should find some solutions and some recommendations to pinpoint the approach that can be undertaken by the government to realize the vision 2041. Bangladesh holds the utmost prospect to emerge as the next big digitized nation in the south Asian region after India. With the sprout of a technically sound young generation that makes up a large portion of our population,  we are already on our way to building a great digitized nation.  \nIndex Terms - Digital Bangladesh,  Digital Nation, Networking Insecurity, Vision 2041\n",

                    "Abstract- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is complete automation that is often misunderstood and very rarely realized in the world of Virtual Office Automation world. A true ERP is an integrated system that is capable of handling any business activity both big and small including silly calls like finding out if some sweeper was present or absent on a certain date or finding out when a big-time project will be moved to production adding significant value to overall business processes in place. Organizations at times use Executive Information System (EIS), Enterprise Information System (EntIS), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) or in some cases automation to multiple modules automating selected business processes and are referred to as ERP in Bangladesh and possibly some other countries as well. The implementation of ERP requires capital investment. Both misinterpretation and misrepresentation of ERP may cause havoc to investors in terms of costs associated with running an organization. The main objective of the research is to review a good number of published journals in the ERP research arena and shed some light on identifying attributes for true ERP from the unauthentic ones.\n\nIndex Terms - ERP, Virtual Office, EIS, MRP II, Capital Investment\n",

It is\nfocused on the shade differences, reflectance%, color strength (K/S value), wash, rubbing and perspiration\nfastness following cotton fabric is dyed with both ground water and sea water. The fabric samples are 100%\ncotton single jersey. The quality parameters such as shade differences, reflectance %, color strength, wash,\nrubbing and perspiration fastness of the both dyed samples have been compared and it has been found that the\nsea water dyed fabric samples are lighter in shade and the results of quality parameters are satisfactory.\nKeywords: ground water, sea water, color fastness, color strength, reflectance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

                    "The scope of the establishment of internetworking security is large enough that requires special attention to details to realize its ultimate wholesome state. As soon as the Data/Information is placed in a medium to transmit over to the next hop, it is at risk of being fabricated by the Man-in-the-middle. Over the years many encryption/decryption algorithms were invented to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the content co compiled at the sender end. Cryptography is a subset of cryptography that only deals with encrypting data that can be passed through secure channels along with keys to ensure security. Where cryptology deals with both encryption and decryption processes. Cryptographic algorithms are primarily categorized into two types - Symmetric and Asymmetric. The main objective of this review paper is to identify how some public (asymmetric) and private (symmetric) keys algorithms fare against each category with respect to attack resistance, efficiency, and other relative measures. Two symmetric algorithms namely Hill Cipher and Data Encryption Standards (DES) were compared against two well known asymmetric key algorithms namely RSA and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in this study. The computational and implementation complexities of the algorithms were parts of the discussion as well.\n",

                    "Abstract- Internet banking has become a crucial aspect of modern financial transactions, enabling customers to access their account information and perform various transactions from anywhere. Ensuring the security of these transactions is one of utmost importance, and this is where authentication protocols come into play. One such protocol is Kerberos, which is widely used for secure authentication in many applications, including internet banking. In this paper we discuss the basic operations and functionalities of Kerberos while pinpointing the    advantages of using Kerberos as an authentication protocol in internet banking. We also discuss the security features of using Kerberos, including its use of encrypted tickets and its ability to prevent replay attacks.\n\nIndex Terms- Internet Banking, Cyber Security, Authentication, Kerberos, Multi factor authentication server, Replay attack.\n",

                    "Abstract\nThe use of technology in all parts of our lives has greatly increased in recent years, nowadays, people tend to\nsearch for everything online before they make decisions. However, looking for rental houses online is not\ncommon in Bangladesh, it is not because people do not want to, but because there are not many online\nplatforms focusing on residential rentals. For the mentioned reason we developed a house rental finding web\napplication using Laravel, Vue.js, and PHP-ML library. Laravel handles the backend whereas Vue.js manages\nthe frontend, we utilized PHP Machine Learning LibraryÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to build a machine learning model for the search system. The goal is to make it easier to find\nrental properties. Our system gives personalized suggestions based on user inputs, like location, rental price,\nproperty size, and the number of rooms and bathrooms. Our application aims to make searching for rental\nhouses a better experience and more efficient.\nKeywords: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),\nMachine Learning (ML), JavaScript (JS), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)\n",

This is a review paper. There are some research works that were carried out in this arena but none really pinpointed the exact issues and ways to deal with those problems. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the actual reasons behind information insecurity as well as to provide some recommendations to minimize the insecurity which may help realize the dream of Digital Bangladesh. The main contribution of the work lies in the form of networking insecurity -the prime impediment to Digital Bangladesh. This study should find some solutions and some recommendations to pinpoint the approach that can be undertaken by the government to realize the vision 2041. Bangladesh holds the utmost prospect to emerge as the next big digitized nation in the south Asian region after India. With the sprout of a technically sound young generation that makes up a large portion of our population,  we are already on our way to building a great digitized nation.  \nIndex Terms - Digital Bangladesh,  Digital Nation, Networking Insecurity, Vision 2041\n",

                    "Abstract- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is complete automation that is often misunderstood and very rarely realized in the world of Virtual Office Automation world. A true ERP is an integrated system that is capable of handling any business activity both big and small including silly calls like finding out if some sweeper was present or absent on a certain date or finding out when a big-time project will be moved to production adding significant value to overall business processes in place. Organizations at times use Executive Information System (EIS), Enterprise Information System (EntIS), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) or in some cases automation to multiple modules automating selected business processes and are referred to as ERP in Bangladesh and possibly some other countries as well. The implementation of ERP requires capital investment. Both misinterpretation and misrepresentation of ERP may cause havoc to investors in terms of costs associated with running an organization. The main objective of the research is to review a good number of published journals in the ERP research arena and shed some light on identifying attributes for true ERP from the unauthentic ones.\n\nIndex Terms - ERP, Virtual Office, EIS, MRP II, Capital Investment\n",

                    "ABSTRACT: In this work we look for the possibilities of using sea water for cotton fabric dyeing. It is\nfocused on the shade differences, reflectance%, color strength (K/S value), wash, rubbing and perspiration\nfastness following cotton fabric is dyed with both ground water and sea water. The fabric samples are 100%\ncotton single jersey. The quality parameters such as shade differences, reflectance %, color strength, wash,\nrubbing and perspiration fastness of the both dyed samples have been compared and it has been found that the\nsea water dyed fabric samples are lighter in shade and the results of quality parameters are satisfactory.\nKeywords: ground water, sea water, color fastness, color strength, reflectance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

                    "The scope of the establishment of internetworking security is large enough that requires special attention to details to realize its ultimate wholesome state. As soon as the Data/Information is placed in a medium to transmit over to the next hop, it is at risk of being fabricated by the Man-in-the-middle. Over the years many encryption/decryption algorithms were invented to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the content co compiled at the sender end. Cryptography is a subset of cryptography that only deals with encrypting data that can be passed through secure channels along with keys to ensure security. Where cryptology deals with both encryption and decryption processes. Cryptographic algorithms are primarily categorized into two types - Symmetric and Asymmetric. The main objective of this review paper is to identify how some public (asymmetric) and private (symmetric) keys algorithms fare against each category with respect to attack resistance, efficiency, and other relative measures. Two symmetric algorithms namely Hill Cipher and Data Encryption Standards (DES) were compared against two well known asymmetric key algorithms namely RSA and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in this study. The computational and implementation complexities of the algorithms were parts of the discussion as well.\n",

                    "Abstract- Internet banking has become a crucial aspect of modern financial transactions, enabling customers to access their account information and perform various transactions from anywhere. Ensuring the security of these transactions is one of utmost importance, and this is where authentication protocols come into play. One such protocol is Kerberos, which is widely used for secure authentication in many applications, including internet banking. In this paper we discuss the basic operations and functionalities of Kerberos while pinpointing the    advantages of using Kerberos as an authentication protocol in internet banking. We also discuss the security features of using Kerberos, including its use of encrypted tickets and its ability to prevent replay attacks.\n\nIndex Terms- Internet Banking, Cyber Security, Authentication, Kerberos, Multi factor authentication server, Replay attack.\n",

                    "Abstract\nThe use of technology in all parts of our lives has greatly increased in recent years, nowadays, people tend to\nsearch for everything online before they make decisions. However, looking for rental houses online is not\ncommon in Bangladesh, it is not because people do not want to, but because there are not many online\nplatforms focusing on residential rentals. For the mentioned reason we developed a house rental finding web\napplication using Laravel, Vue.js, and PHP-ML library. Laravel handles the backend whereas Vue.js manages\nthe frontend, we utilized PHP Machine Learning LibraryÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to build a machine learning model for the search system. The goal is to make it easier to find\nrental properties. Our system gives personalized suggestions based on user inputs, like location, rental price,\nproperty size, and the number of rooms and bathrooms. Our application aims to make searching for rental\nhouses a better experience and more efficient.\nKeywords: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),\nMachine Learning (ML), JavaScript (JS), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)\n",

                    "Abstract- The term Digital Bangladesh is a misnomer. Like every other nation in the world, Bangladesh has a strong desire to become a digitized nation to realize the vision 2041. This is a review paper. There are some research works that were carried out in this arena but none really pinpointed the exact issues and ways to deal with those problems. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the actual reasons behind information insecurity as well as to provide some recommendations to minimize the insecurity which may help realize the dream of Digital Bangladesh. The main contribution of the work lies in the form of networking insecurity -the prime impediment to Digital Bangladesh. This study should find some solutions and some recommendations to pinpoint the approach that can be undertaken by the government to realize the vision 2041. Bangladesh holds the utmost prospect to emerge as the next big digitized nation in the south Asian region after India. With the sprout of a technically sound young generation that makes up a large portion of our population,  we are already on our way to building a great digitized nation.  \nIndex Terms - Digital Bangladesh,  Digital Nation, Networking Insecurity, Vision 2041\n",

                    "Abstract- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is complete automation that is often misunderstood and very rarely realized in the world of Virtual Office Automation world. A true ERP is an integrated system that is capable of handling any business activity both big and small including silly calls like finding out if some sweeper was present or absent on a certain date or finding out when a big-time project will be moved to production adding significant value to overall business processes in place. Organizations at times use Executive Information System (EIS), Enterprise Information System (EntIS), Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) or in some cases automation to multiple modules automating selected business processes and are referred to as ERP in Bangladesh and possibly some other countries as well. The implementation of ERP requires capital investment. Both misinterpretation and misrepresentation of ERP may cause havoc to investors in terms of costs associated with running an organization. The main objective of the research is to review a good number of published journals in the ERP research arena and shed some light on identifying attributes for true ERP from the unauthentic ones.\n\nIndex Terms - ERP, Virtual Office, EIS, MRP II, Capital Investment\n",

It is\nfocused on the shade differences, reflectance%, color strength (K/S value), wash, rubbing and perspiration\nfastness following cotton fabric is dyed with both ground water and sea water. The fabric samples are 100%\ncotton single jersey. The quality parameters such as shade differences, reflectance %, color strength, wash,\nrubbing and perspiration fastness of the both dyed samples have been compared and it has been found that the\nsea water dyed fabric samples are lighter in shade and the results of quality parameters are satisfactory.\nKeywords: ground water, sea water, color fastness, color strength, reflectance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

                  paperAbstract:
                    "A fuzzy number is a concept that represents a real number abstractly. It doesnât assign a single value, but instead a range of uncertain values, each with its own weight between 0 and 1. It is essential to comprehend the arithmetic operations of fuzzy numbers in the real number of fuzzy mathematics. One of the fundamental concepts that should not be ignored is the explanation of the interval operation. In this paper, a composition table is constructed to demonstrate the multiplication and division of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy arithmetic operations are commonly utilized to solve mathematical equations that involve fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we explore the relationship between multiplication and division operations and fuzzy numbers. We also demonstrate that the shape of their membership functions heavily influences the outcome of our calculations when using fuzzy numbers.",

                    "The medicinal plants grown in Bangladesh have pharmacological importance and the raw material source that may be applied to produce different drugs in pharmaceutical industries. The major and trace elements in medicinal plants are essential nutrients known as minerals in the human body. In this study, Curcuma zedoarya (leaf), Curcuma zedoaria (bough), Euphorbia hirta (leaf), Mimosa pudica (bough), and Mimosa pudica (root) were investigated using the Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) technique. The samples (pellets) were irradiated by 2.5 MeV proton beam of 3 MV Van de Graff accelerator. The spectrum data were collected using PIXE data acquisition setup & MAESTRO-32 and analyzed by GUPIX/DAN-32 software technique. Specifically, the goal of this research was to identify concentration of heavy and trace elements that are important for many physiological and biochemical processes for human beings. Interestingly, Ca and S showed the highest concentration, while Zn and Ni revealed the lowest concentration in medicinal plants. The results have been compared with allowable limits of IAEA-V-10 and IAEA-359. Owing to these reports, the uses of these plants are not entirely protected from health risks. Further studies would give adequate information to assess the importance of medicinal plants that may contribute to human health.",
